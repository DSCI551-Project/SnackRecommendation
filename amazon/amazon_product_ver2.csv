These are a very different beast from the American-style rice cakes that most people associate with the name--as other reviews suggest, these aren't quite so air-filled or crumbly, having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread. But unlike those, these are gluten-free, oil-free, unsalted, and contain only one ingredient: 100% puffed brown rice. They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact. They're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset, since they're light and bland and don't require the preparation of other bland foods.<br /><br />Try them with hummus! My personal favorite: peanut butter, jam, and a sprinkling of chia seeds. Yum!";"B000FDKUSO";"B000FDKUSO";"Suzie's Puffed Brown Rice Unsalted Thin Cakes Case of 12 packages 4.6 oz.

And worth every penny!";"I am so happy that Amazon got these back in so I could order my second case. I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.<br /><br />I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them.

Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

If I'm extra hungry , I'll cook it on the stovetop with frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn, broccoli, etc) with some garlic salt and hot sauce and you've got a savory and healthy dinner. If I'm in the mood for something sweet, I'll add bananas and drizzle in some honey. A bowl of this with an over-easy egg and you've got a very filling snack under 250 calories. With a regular meal, I'll sub out my starch (rice, pasta, bread) with this oatmeal for a healthy alternative. For me, I feel more full with oatmeal as the side dish probably because it fools my stomach with extra water weight but the fiber content keeps me feeling full or at least content until the next meal.<br /><br />Think outside the box and be open to new flavors and new textures, and you will thoroughly enjoy this product as much as I have, AND feel healthy doing so :)";"B005EL6VOY";"B005EL6VOY";"Coach's Oats 100% Whole Grain Oatmeal, 4.5 lbs";"S-Coach";"oatmeal-breakfast-cereals";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EL6VOY";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51haS6pFxfL._SL160_.jpg";"BREAKFAST_CEREAL"

Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.<br /><br />I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.<br /><br />I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it!

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR!

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

The almost uniformly highly positive reviews here made me decide to try Pernigotti, another Dutch processed cocoa. I've cooked with cocoa over the years but am not in the habit of doing so recently. My usage has been limited to hot cocoa, and that's what I have tried so far with the Pernigotti, and I've compared it several times with both Droste and Valrhona cocoa. They are all good, but somewhat different. I definitely notice the vanilla accent of the Pernigotti. I wasn't sure I liked that at first, but decided that it's a subtle accent and not too intrusive. I wasn't used to it, but I think it's OK. The chocolate flavor is very nice, I think maybe better than the Droste, even, which was the best cocoa I had ever experienced. I once bought a can of Hershey's cocoa to see if it was OK, this was back in the 1970's and I was disgusted and I think I actually returned it to the market for a refund. I prefer Droste to Valrhona, but I may have found a new favorite now. The reviews at Amazon for Droste cocoa are not nearly as positive as for Pernigotti. Droste is more expensive here, but I can get it locally for about the same as the Pernigotti online, however I may stick with the Pernigotti now.<br /><br />I have developed a system for making hot cocoa that removes the guess work and results in uniformly pleasing cups of hot cocoa. Here it is:<br /><br />It's (by weight) 1 part cocoa, 2 parts sugar, 3 parts non fat dry milk, all mixed very well together and stored. To make, boil 3 parts water, pour over 1 part the mixture (again, by weight), stir well.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I dug up a long time favorite chocolate recipe of mine (my own creation) and tried it with the Pernigotti -- Cocoa Pecan Cookies. It came out great. This recipe is to make cookie rolls, you bake a batch very quickly and easily any time you care to. To prepare the cookies, you preheat the oven, slice up a cookie roll, spread the slices on a cookie sheet and bake. Very simple. Here's the recipe:<br /><br />Cocoa Pecan Cookies<br />(Dough for 8 batches)<br /><br />1 stick melted butter<br />3/4 c. cocoa powder<br />1.5 c sugar<br />2 eggs (large)<br />2 c flour<br />1/2 t salt (this can be adjusted according to preference)<br />1 t baking soda<br />1 t vanilla (this was with Droste cocoa, since Pernigotti has vanilla this can be eliminated or adjusted)<br />1 cup pecans (previously kept in freezer to prevent staling)<br /><br />Melt or soften the butter. Put all the above except the flour and pecans in bowl and beat well. Add 3/4 of the flour and beat and then add last portion of flour (1/2 cup) and mix in. Then add the pecans and mix reasonably well and then scoop out on a floured board and knead to get the nuts evenly distributed. Cut in 2 and cut one of those in 2. Take one of those and roll to about 10 inches long and cut it in 2 (you have an eighth). Cylinder should be about 1 inch thick and about 5 inches long. Press ends to flatten with blade and put in pan. Do same with the rest and put pan in bag, seal and place in refrigerator to firm for a few hours. Remove the rolls to plastic bag for refrigerated storage.<br /><br />To cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees, using sharp knfe slice one cookie roll into approximately 30 cookies, place them evenly on cookie sheet (teflon coated) and cook 10 minutes. Immediately scrape off with plastic spatula and let cool upside down. They should cool to crispness if they've been cooked properly. Cook only to that point and no more or there will be some burning.

The only cocoa I found that remotely reminds me of this one is Schokinag. I found this at Williams-Sonoma, but it's priced much better here, even with shipping.  The only thing I have to say, to those who are not aware that there is a difference between Dutch Process and regular cocoa, is that you have to either watch the recipes you use it in or find a way to modify the recipe you have. I did the latter for the chocolate cake and it was wonderful. My brownies, which don't need modification came out so perfect that no one could believe that just changing the cocoa made that much of a difference.

One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.

He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"""">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"""" without the misery of a poorly aging dog.

The amount of salt is low - 100 mg per serving - which brings up the challenge, limiting your consumption.  I like the smaller size bag - reminds me to eat less and also takes up less space.

I would never purchase any other chips but these.<br /><br />The 12-pack of 5-oz bags shipped in a carton-inside-a-carton, arriving in great condition.  The chip bags are a sturdy plastic, and all chips appear to be in good condition.  Notably, these appear to have hardly any broken chips.<br /><br />A 1-oz. serving has only 140 calories, and 40% of your daily Vitamin C!  If eating only 1/5 of a bag of chips sounds unlikely to you, it's possible you could do it with these, since they are rich and leave you feeling sated.  I think that is because these are real food, rather than junk food.<br /><br />The individual chips roughly average 2 inches in diameter, some of them being folded in various shapes, and some flat.  The chip size is much more consistent than you usually see.  It's hard to tell, but I think these are unpeeled potatoes, of the variety that has a light-toned skin.  They are definitely thin chips, but I would say they are slightly thicker than Lay's potato chips.  The sea salt is used in balanced proportion, and adds nice flavor.  The avocado oil lends a very tasty, extremely subtle flavor that hints of citrus and fruitiness.  However, don't get me wrong - these don't taste fruity or sweet; they taste like regular potato chips.

They come in nice individual packages, each package has three thins.  A perfect amount for a snack and kind of stops you from eating more. Maybe not totally stop, but at least make you think about opening the next one!<br /><br />The best price on them is at Costco at $6.99.  I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter ""price history alert"""" in Google it will be come up at the top";" it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

When we were kids, my parents used to buy us a box of our favorite cereal (cereal was a 'treat' in our house) as one of our Christmas gifts.  In contrast to the rest of the year, we didn't have to share 'our' box with any of the other kids.  The oldest of my younger sisters favorite cereal was Lucky Charms.  After getting her box, she would sit down with two bowls and sort the cereal from the marshmallows.  She'd dump the cereal back in the box and eat it as you normally would cereal.  But the marshmallows, she'd keep those aside, eating them like candy.<br /><br />Now, all grown up, she still loves Lucky Charms, and her two boys, 6 and 7 love them as well.  For Christmas this year, she decided to give them a special surprise from 'Santa'.  She saved an empty Lucky Charms box and the bag.  I had a gold burnishing cream that we used to burnish the box a gold color, but allowed the picture to show through underneath.  Then we filled the bag with these marshmallows and sealed it with my Seal-A-Meal.  Her boys were so surprised when they got up on Christmas morning and found a 'magic' box of cereal from Santa - with only marshmallows (the most important part) inside!<br /><br />My sister was happy, too, because it only took two of the three bags of these marshmallows to fill the box, which meant she had an extra bag to enjoy herself.

Also I've had black truffles on french dishes in restaurants of which I also was quite fond. So I looked up various truffle options and decided to give this salt a try. The reviews were lauding this product as being the best thing to the fresh truffle itself .. But alas I was disappointed and really kind of frustrated. Maybe it's 'cause I've had the real thing, but no because the truffle oil is still not an issue. The problem is the strong and distinctive quality of this product which doesn't always enhance but rather changes the flavor of foods I've put it on directly. Unfortunately I haven't always found this change for the better. But it has been OK in soups or stews where the flavor is blended in. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something? I don't know if this sort of thing is like wine where storage conditions can damage it?

It is at least two or three times better (in taste) than the Healthy Pop, yet it has only slightly more calories, and relatively little fat.  The Healthy Pop actually tastes bland, compared to the LIGHT Crispy & White.  As a result, I think I should change my rating for the Healthy Pop to about 3 Stars.

I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.

Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house?

They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.

So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.)

I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone.

I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008.

Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78°F, then it turns liquid.  Thus, there shouldn't be much of an issue of ""melting it"""" to cook something as one person stated.

I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many ""What to use coconut oil for"""" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly";" the real thing I use it for";" is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1";" and a substitute for shortening at .75:1";" meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.

When I got back to my dorm it was already beginning to thicken up. I was also very happy to see that there was no spill. I got this coconut oil to use in my hair and I could not be happier. My hair is really soft and it seems like its melts away kinks and tangles that can come with hair 7 weeks post relaxer. My hair is super soft, moisturized, and shiny. I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with. But since I've stopped using that coconut oil that issue is just about nonexistent.

It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need.

155326;"B000GAT6NG";"A2AKOKIF0S0R4Q";"Vanessa Marie";24;25;5;1331251200;"COMPARISON REVIEW to Nature's Way";"When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Instead, my review will focus on using Nutiva Organic Coocnut oil as a beautifying product.  I bought the 54-ounce jar for using on my hair and skin.  So here's what I think of it as part of a beauty/skincare/haircare regime.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product at a great price.  Sure, you could get a jar of coconut oil at the grocery store but it's quality wouldn't compare to Nutiva coconut oil which is food quality, organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  I was so excited when this product arrived that I tried it out immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely smell.  The product smells good enough to eat straight out of the container and I admit I did taste a bit while applying it to my skin and hair.  My other observation is that it melts so easily in the hands and applies so well to both hair and skin.  My less expensive, refined Superdrug coconut oil cannot compare to Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil.  The cheaper coconut oils have hard, white bits in them and do not smell like actual coconut.  Nutiva is smooth/silky and melts easily in the hands without leaving behind white balls/clumps that the cheaper refined coconut oils have.  I love Nutiva so much that I emptied all my cheap Superdrug coconut oil into the rubbish bin and scooped some Nutiva Coconut oil into the little Superdrug canister and put it in my bathroom for easy access.  I am using Nutiva a few times a week on my body and hair.  Before bed, I scoop some Nutiva onto my hands and rub my hands together causing it to melt.  It melts quickly and I rub it onto my skin and hair (can be applied to wet, damp, or dry hair easily).  I saturate my hair with it and use a shower cap to do an overnight heavy oiling treatment.  In the morning I shower as normal and shampoo or condition it out using a clarifying conditioner.  This creates beautifully silky, shiny hair and skin! There are so many benefits to the body using this oil.  I highly recommend it and hope that it will always be sold on Amazon.";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne.<br />After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did...

I read all the positive reviews and I have to agree with most of them. The coconut oil tastes delicious, I kind of want to eat out of the jar- I'm not sure I can say this about any other oil haha. I spread the solid form a litte bit on some crackers to try it and it was delicious, I used it on some banana bread in place of regular butter- delicious. I haven't really noticed the flavor in any of the foods I cook. I made sauteed spinach and chicken nuggets. I actually fried the chicken nuggets and I think they came out quite well actually. I could go on, but overall I am very happy with this product and it is definitly money well spent.<br /><br />The only down side is I just got it on Saturday and less than a week later I already used half a jar- so my law student budget might be streched a little thin. It would be nice also to see if the claims that it helps you loose weight are true.

By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.

It also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home--in fact, I love the way it smells when I'm sauteeing food.<br /><br />What sold me on this product was that I read you could eat it on toast. I thought that was weird, but decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it like that, I had meetings all day. I am ALWAYS hungry, and always snacking. I really eat about every 2 hours. Well, that day, about 5 hours had gone by before I realized I was hungry! I thought it was a fluke since I was so busy that day. A few days later, I tried it again.

Works great as a hot oil treatment for your hair - since coconut oil is in a solid form at 76 degrees or less - just heat up a small amount in a container and apply to your hair.";"B000GAT6NG";"B000GAT6NG";"Nutiva Organic, Unrefined, Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAT6NG";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k3yi-eGmL._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

There's no real cinnamon in them.  I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips.  They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips.<br /><br />Well, curiosity killed the cat.  Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods.....  I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it.  I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW.  Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of  artificial color!  I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing.  Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips.  Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give.<br /><br />Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star?  My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.<br /><br />Ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips:<br />Sugar; nonfat milk; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel and soybean oil); palm kernel oil; contains 2% or less of: cornstarch; artificial colors (Yellow 6 Lake; Yellow 5 Lake; Blue 2 Lake); natural and artificial flavor; salt; palm oil; soy lecithin.";"B000IMSSHM";"B000IMSSHM";"HERSHEY'S Kitchens Cinnamon Chips, 10 Ounce (Pack of 6)";"HERSHEY'S";"";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IMSSHM";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NnfBsbIaL._SL160_.jpg";"GROCERY"

I get severe stomach pains when eating anything with gluten it it and this oatmeal does not affect me at all. It is the best tasting oatmeal that I've eaten and I grew up on oatmeal, am now 69 years old. In the past I've always bought the Old Fashioned oatmeal and prefer to eat it raw with apple juice on it, cinnamon and raisins. Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free oatmeal needs to be cooked as it is straight grain that has been steel cut, not refined so it would be a little hard to eat raw.

I bought these after seeing Ryan Hall rave about them on his blog. Here are a few thoughts.<br /><br />They may seem expensive, but what I found is that they are so filling, we don't have to eat much. We make 3 servings per meal (I usually eat 2 and my wife 1). This is 1 cup which is about a 1/7 of the box. That meal ends up being about $0.75 for the two of us! Also, most pancakes usually have tons of calories, I can eat two servings, be comfortably full and only have eaten 260 calories. That's amazing!<br /><br />They are very quick to make. We have only made pancakes so far, but it only takes about 20 seconds of whisking. How easy is that?<br /><br />As for taste, I'm not AMAZED but they are good. They are boarder-line bland, so I put a little butter spray on them. We often mix them with fruit. However, for wholegrain... I'd say they are excellent. We've started mixing in protein powder and that has the potential to improve the taste depending on the protein you use.<br /><br />Healthy, cheap, easy, tasty, hearty... what more do you want?";"B003EJ9KLO";"B003EJ9KLO";"Kodiak Cakes Frontier Pancake, Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Original, 24 Ounce (Pack of 6) (10705599011167)";"Kodiak Cakes";"pancake-and-waffle-mixes";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003EJ9KLO";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510k0ckMvaL._SL160_.jpg";"BAKING_MIX"

However, it seems Amazon is cheaper (when you buy in bulk) and has a much wider selection.  I just wanted to say, though, that I absolutely love this mint tea.  The mint really wakes me up as it is so refreshing, but it is also calming.  I drink at least a couple of cups daily and especially when I am studying.  All Celestial Seasonings herbal teas are fantastic, and I've grown up drinking them.  They are my favorite teas -always top quality and nearly all the herbal teas are caffeine free.  I also like the Mandarin Orange and Cinnamon Apple Spice a lot.  Red Zinger and Lemon Zinger (love this one when I have an irritated throat) are hits, but the Honey Vanilla Chamomile isn't among my favorites -I prefer the regular Chamomile.  Finally, Sleepy Time Tea is something quite special and I drink it once in a while; it really helps me to sleep quickly and sleep throughout the night without waking up at all.<br /><br />Drinking tea is so good for your health as long as you stick with decaf herbal teas.  It's a good way to relax, stay hydrated, and flush out toxins.  These teas are so good that you don't even need honey, but sometimes a bit of honey is nice (also try organic blue agave nectar).<br /><br />Happy tea drinking everyone!";"B000E67210";"B000E67210";"Celestial Seasonings Herbal Tea, Mint Magic, 20 Count (Pack of 6)";"Celestial Seasonings";"herbal-teas";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E67210";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DLt5oi60L._SL160_.jpg";"TEA"

Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"""" has a fine pedigree";" coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets";" and";" most especially";" because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact";" agave nectar is marketed as """"diabetic friendly"""". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out";" quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose";" which although it has a low-glycemic index";" is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I know my 6 ounce in this popcorn made 7 small square boxes of popcorn so this makes more than that but keep in mind this popcorn tastes awesome cold too.  Keep it in a cool area so the oil side does not melt (easier to handle not messy).

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack""""";" our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online.

He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older.

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"""" without the misery of a poorly aging dog.

So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.)

It arrived fairly quickly, but had leaked a bit inside it's box (I suppose that's to be expected with trying to ship an oil in the middle of summer).  I've had it for a month or so and it's only just starting to solidify in the cupboard.<br /><br />The oil smells wonderful, a yummy coconut smell, and when it's heated in a pan it just smells that much better. I use it every time I pan fry anything (eggs, fish, chicken, etc) and it always works wonderfully.  I haven't noticed it adding any coconut flavor to anything really, except perhaps eggs which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />I have used it in baking a couple of times and have had only one issue.  Because it's a 'solid' oil (depending on temperature) when I added cold eggs to the oil and didn't mix fast enough it started to chunk up so things didn't mix very smoothly.<br /><br />I should also add that my son has exzema and has since he was born.

I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008. Now, I use coconut oil on weekends as my ""weekend treat"""" in homemade popcorn.  (Not eating sugar really made me lose weight:  1#/week for 30 weeks";" where I've remained for months.)<br /><br />This Nutiva jar is easy to open.  It's probably good to keep smaller amounts in another container to keep the big jar less contaminated . . . but I don't always do that.<br /><br />There was a slight coconut scent at first but that disappeared.  When I lick off the spoon when I make popcorn";" I can taste a little bit of coconut";" but not much.

If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil.

I originally first tried the stuff at Walmart, and it had no flavor to it at all, very bland.<br /><br />To combat some of the poor reviews I read on this oil, I think a lot of those are just due to people not doing their research before buying, and thus they're just being snippity pickeys.  Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78°F, then it turns liquid.  Thus, there shouldn't be much of an issue of ""melting it"""" to cook something as one person stated.

I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many ""What to use coconut oil for"""" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly";" the real thing I use it for";" is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1";" and a substitute for shortening at .75:1";" meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.  Check this page out:<br />[...]<br /><br />The ChezUs recipe for banana bread is awesome.

My hair is really soft and it seems like its melts away kinks and tangles that can come with hair 7 weeks post relaxer. My hair is super soft, moisturized, and shiny. I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with.

It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need. I know it's ""different strokes for different folks""""";"but I'd recommend this oil to anybody. If you use it for foods and personal hygiene like myself";"I recommend the 54 oz. container.

The taste was making me want to throw up.  Instead of giving up on it, each time I would take a spoonfull, I would pull my tongue in and hold my breath, so that I couldn't smell or taste it.

264195;"B004EAGP74";"A2AKOKIF0S0R4Q";"Vanessa Marie";24;25;5;1331251200;"COMPARISON REVIEW to Nature's Way";"When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Plus I found out they were processed.  Nutiva is raw.  I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used.<br />My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions.  I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.

After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Instead, my review will focus on using Nutiva Organic Coocnut oil as a beautifying product.  I bought the 54-ounce jar for using on my hair and skin.  So here's what I think of it as part of a beauty/skincare/haircare regime.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product at a great price.  Sure, you could get a jar of coconut oil at the grocery store but it's quality wouldn't compare to Nutiva coconut oil which is food quality, organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  I was so excited when this product arrived that I tried it out immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely smell.  The product smells good enough to eat straight out of the container and I admit I did taste a bit while applying it to my skin and hair.  My other observation is that it melts so easily in the hands and applies so well to both hair and skin.  My less expensive, refined Superdrug coconut oil cannot compare to Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil.  The cheaper coconut oils have hard, white bits in them and do not smell like actual coconut.  Nutiva is smooth/silky and melts easily in the hands without leaving behind white balls/clumps that the cheaper refined coconut oils have.  I love Nutiva so much that I emptied all my cheap Superdrug coconut oil into the rubbish bin and scooped some Nutiva Coconut oil into the little Superdrug canister and put it in my bathroom for easy access.  I am using Nutiva a few times a week on my body and hair.  Before bed, I scoop some Nutiva onto my hands and rub my hands together causing it to melt.  It melts quickly and I rub it onto my skin and hair (can be applied to wet, damp, or dry hair easily).  I saturate my hair with it and use a shower cap to do an overnight heavy oiling treatment.  In the morning I shower as normal and shampoo or condition it out using a clarifying conditioner.  This creates beautifully silky, shiny hair and skin! There are so many benefits to the body using this oil.  I highly recommend it and hope that it will always be sold on Amazon.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne.<br />After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did... Finding your balance is the most important thing - what is right for some is not always right for all - I will report back in a few months to let you know if the coconut oil has continued to impress me.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

Recently I found the 8 pound pail available, and decided it would be a good purchase since coconut oil has such a long shelf life.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said there was a difference between the pail product and jar product, I was concerned. However, after having used both I can assure you that the product you buy in jars is the same product packed in the large pail.<br /><br />Eight pounds of wonderful coconutty goodness, creamy and fragrant and delicious! Since it turns liquid in warmer temps, I poured the liquid into my olive oil dispenser and can now add oil to my skillets without having liquid coconut oil running all down the sides of the jar. When the weather cools down I'll have to make other arrangements, of course. But this coconut oil is fabulous and a bargain at this price!<br /><br />I might have to order another one soon as my mother likes this also, and took some of my coconut oil.<br /><br />*Edit 6-14-11: when I purchased this and raved about what a bargain it was, the pail cost me just a little over $50.00  You may find that doing the math on any additional price increases changes whether this is a bargain for you or not.";"B004EAGP74";"B004EAGP74";"Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 Oz";"Nutiva";"coconut-oils";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EAGP74";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Oe1VR4o0L._SL160_.jpg";"EDIBLE_OIL_VEGETABLE"

In the meantime, another acquaintance told me about a mutual friend who'd lost 75 lbs from using Nutiva. After that, I was more than curious--I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I'd tried a different brand of coconut oil before and was not impressed. It was very grainy and hard. Nutiva is very smooth. It's got a beautiful creamy texture and is very white. It also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home--in fact, I love the way it smells when I'm sauteeing food.<br /><br />What sold me on this product was that I read you could eat it on toast. I thought that was weird, but decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it like that, I had meetings all day. I am ALWAYS hungry, and always snacking. I really eat about every 2 hours. Well, that day, about 5 hours had gone by before I realized I was hungry! I thought it was a fluke since I was so busy that day. A few days later, I tried it again. And once again, several hours went by and I wasn't a bit hungry.<br /><br />I am convinced there is something to weight loss with this product.

About once a week I saturate my hair with this oil and leave it in for 15 minutes to 1 hour before I shower, then I shampoo 2-3 times so my hair's not greasy and do not need conditioner for a few days. I also apply the oil to my skin after I wash, but while still in the shower. Then I just lightly rinse the oil off with water only, after giving it a few minutes to soak in. This way my skin gets moisturized without that greasy residue that usually takes so long to soak in. Good for when you are headed to work and don't want that greasy look for an hour or so after application. Nutiva previously had a truly raw version of this oil, but just found out from their website the Nutiva folk's supplier of the raw oil could not keep up with demand so they had to remove it from their site!

If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams.

See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture?  Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!)  The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE!  Sooo unappetizing.  And false advertising, IMHO.<br /><br />Now for the taste.  Another disappointment.  They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah!  You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean.  Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous!  These are no better.  Yuck!<br /><br />Now for the size.  I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch.  These just don't RISE!  See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape?  Nuh-uh.  Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening?  Dunno.  But they puff up only about 1/16"" of a centimeter.  Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br /><br />Now for the boxed ingredients.  Cheesh";" you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work.  Butter";" milk";" eggs";" and fruit/nuts/whatever.  Fer cryin' out loud";" it's truly no more trouble";" and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review.  But I just cannot.  Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:<br /><br />Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!!

I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter (including stirring, not mixing, the milk and muffin mix at the end), with one exception: I add 1/4 tsp. more vanilla than instructed (3/4 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. vanilla).  Then I've added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries to a few batches and 2 mashed ripe bananas to other batches.<br /><br />All of my batches have come out of the oven picture-perfectly raised to a gentle peak and golden-brown, not too dry on the bottom.  They are light and fluffy on the inside, buttery and slightly crispy on top.  Mine actually look better than the box (in my opinion, see photo); they rise a little higher than shown on the box.<br /><br />These muffins do tend to stick to the muffin paper unless you let them cool, initially.  When re-heating, I microwave them for 30 seconds and then remove the paper; I don't know why, but with this method the paper comes off very cleanly.  When either fresh out of the oven or chilled, the paper sticks; they need to be slightly warm to avoid the paper sticking too much.  Sometimes after microwaving and removing the paper, I will lightly toast it in the toaster oven to give the top a little crispiness.<br /><br />This mix seems to be very accommodating to alterations, as others have mentioned.  I am thrilled with this product and will buy it again.<br /><br />**I found I need to bake them a few minutes longer, up to 30 minutes, when using frozen berries rather than fresh berries, and 25 min. is sufficient when making these plain.

Even made it one time with just OJ instead of milk and no mix-ins (we were at my folks' and had already started mixing when we realized there was no GFCF milk); they were delicious that way, too!<br /><br />One tip I would like to share with everyone: Instead of mixing the whole package of dry ingredients and the whole cup of milk at once, mix like an old-fashioned cake recipe and alternate the dry & the milk.

I see some serious yogurt and cheesemaking in my very near future. Buy this, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. I'm going to test this on my teenagers, bet you they can't tell the difference from the $4-$5 gallons of milk I buy daily, either. Thank you Bob!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I tested this milk on my teens, they suggested I add a teaspoon or two of sugar to every gallon. I did, and now they beg me to make it. Very creamy, very good milk with a lot less calories than the red cap milk I normally bought.

For yogurt I use it 1:3 with water instead of 1:7 as recommended. We strain the yogurt afterward, but it's already nice and firm when it's first made. The taste is rich and creamy--excellent!<br /><br />Two warnings. This is not instant milk. It's a very fine powder. So don't dump it into a bowl--it will disperse in the air and get everywhere. And when mixing, use vigorous whisking or a blender, as others have said. So measure carefully and gently, and mix well. It's definitely worth it.<br /><br />Second, this milk is not fortified with vitamin D like liquid milk is. Plenty of calcium, but if you are watching your vitamin D, especially in winter here in the dark north land, make sure you have other sources and are getting some sun.<br /><br />Those are the only drawbacks we've found. There isn't much savings over liquid organic milk (if any) at our local prices. But the flavor is great, it doesn't take up room in your fridge, and the shelf life is great.<br /><br />Oh, and if you make your own yogurt and are used to scalding your milk, there is another huge advantage. No scalding. Just mix with 100-110  degree water and some plain yogurt as starter, and you're ready to go. Incubate six hours in a well-insulated container, and you're good to go. As I said, we strain it through cheesecloth afterward, but that's only if you want a more Greek style. Then we blend with maple syrup/fruit syrup, or sugar syrup. Blending gives a very nice, smooth consistency.<br /><br />Without the need for scalding and then cooling the milk, this is a very easy process.

Maybe that is why I have only had one cavity? Anyway, I know milk is fattening so I have at least restricted myself to skim after gradually going from whole to 2%, to 1%, to 1/2%. But I was still concerned about all the hormones in milk and wanted the added convenience of long term unrefrigerated storage for camping and emergency food supplies. I was skeptical of powdered milk but decided to take a chance with Bob's based on the good reviews here. What a surprise to find that I like this milk BETTER than my store bought skim. It tastes just a tad creamier than skim. Did I say I love this milk? When this 4-pack is gone I am getting on the automatic delivery and figure the cost per quart is going to be 82 cents. So not only is it BETTER than my store bought skim but cheaper and LESS calories still. I mix it in a blender with one cup of warm water for about one minute before adding the rest of the water and blending for an additional 15 secs. Perfect.

During that time I had sort of switched to evaporated milk for my milk needs. It doesn't go bad in the time it is open and cold or hot cereal without some milk is impossible to choke down. I had tried the dry milk you buy in stores and have found it impossible to choke down even on cereal. All varieties in the store seem to say ""Instant"""" which means they dissolve easily";" weigh nothing so they fill up the box";" and stink to high heaven even if they age in the bottle after mixed for a few days.<br /><br />I searched in the local stores to find a bag of Bob's milk to try it out";" to no avail";" so I decided to take the plunge and order from Amazon. The milk comes in the same sized bags as all of Bob's other products -- 4 per case-box. I read one review that said it tasted a lot like fresh cows milk. It has been a long time since I have tasted fresh cows milk";" but Bob's milk may taste more like fresh cows milk than the manufactured stuff you buy in the mega-mart.

So after reading the reviews on this one I figured I'd try it.  It mixed well in the blender, I added 1.5 cups of water to 0.5 cup of milk powder, blended it for a little, and then added 2 more cups of water to blend.  It came out fine, but at the bottom was lumps of foam.  Not really a con but I guess it all foams up down there where you add the powder.  I will try mixing it different ways to see if I can get rid of the foam or something, but it's not a huge deal.  It smells like that fresh milk you get from the farm, it doesn't smell like the over processed store milk you buy.  I really don't mind it because I am sure it will just taste fine with my cereal and other things.  For the price of this milk, you get a good deal.  I made a quart and it doesn't even look like I put a dent in the one 26-ounce package.  This stuff can last about 2 years on the shelf.  If this continues to work out, I will never buy expensive milk at the store, this stuff is probably better for me anyways.  So all in all, I gave it a 4 out of 5, because of the foam and because I thought it would taste exactly like the store milk that other people said, but it is a little different.  I am pretty picky when it comes to taste and everything.  I think non-fat and skim milk are two totally different kinds of milk.  I used to think they are the same but I could be wrong.  Skim milk is my favorite.<br /><br />EDIT:  The foam has gone done once refrigerated as I expected so that is good.  Finally took a taste of the milk and it's not at all what I expected.  I guess I just don't like the taste of Fresh Milk but if YOU do then this is the stuff to get.  I guess I can use it for baking or something else or maybe even as cereal milk.  We will see.<br /><br />EDIT(2):  I had the quart of milk in the fridge for a little over 4 hours now.  I added ice cubes to it, about a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and just a couple pours of regular skim milk.  The taste is sooooo much better and tastes like a Vanilla milkshake.  I am so happy with this taste and I suggest you do the same thing if you want it to taste good.  I really think just adding the ice and let it get really cold helped the taste the most though, and the Vanilla was just icing on the cake.  I don't think I needed to add the couple pours of regular milk but I thought I'd give it a try because of what some websites said.  But overall I am now happy I bought this stuff because it's gonna save me so much money than buying a Gallon of milk for 3.75 a gallon and have 1/4 of that be spoiled, etc.  Now I can just make milk whenever I need it and not worry about it.  I suggest you do the steps I have as well.  Don't judge it by how it tastes right after you mix it because if you did, you'd give it a 1 star rating like I was going to.";"B000EDK67K";"B000EDK67K";"Bob's Red Mill Non Fat Dry Milk Powder, 22-ounce (Pack of 4)";"Bob's Red Mill";"powdered-milk";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EDK67K";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41VaAIPki6L._SL160_.jpg";"DAIRY_BASED_DRINK"

The LDS storehouse will allow you to repackage it in their facility in #10 cans that will last for 20 years (which I'm sure is important to some people).  It is worth the inconvenience and hassle (and it is both, although it is also educational) because I can save so much (70% reduction in price if I buy 25#).  you can also buy it in individual #10 cans (about 4#) for a little less than $9.00 per can.<br /><br />So here's the bottom line.

I don't notice any bad smell or aftertaste that always repulsed me when I was a kid and my mom tried to get me to drink powdered milk. As a single person household, it's rare that I can finish off a gallon of milk before it goes bad and I love the idea that I will no longer have to lug up that 8 pound jug of milk up my 31 stairs to my house. I also like the idea of being able to make cheese and yogurt with this powder.<br /><br />Right now, I use this milk for my cereal and my protein drinks. When I want to mix up a protein powder drink, I use 8oz of filtered and chilled water, 1 scoop of protein powder and 2 tablespoons of the powdered milk, cut up a banana into my mixing cup and then use my hand blender and give it a whirl.<br /><br />To reduce on cleanup, I might make 32oz of milk using the hand blender mixing cup add 14 oz water and 1/2 cup of powder milk give it a whirl for 15-30 seconds and put it in a 32oz/quart Rubbermaid leakproof container and then fill up to the 32 oz level and give it a few shakes to finish mixing the quart milk. Then using the my same utensils make my protein drink and one cleanup for two uses.<br /><br />Using a bottle and lots of shaking, I found that it doesn't always fully dissolve the powder until the next day as some have mentioned, but to me, it's not much of an annoyance. If I feel like drinking the milk straight, I might sometimes add a packet of Splenda to 32 oz of the prepared milk and then it tastes better than fresh milk, without adding calories.<br /><br />For my daily use at home to save time, I now make up 10 ready to mix dry protein drinks Baggies at one time. I measure 2 tbls of this dry milk and 1 scoop of my Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate or Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powders. then I simply measure 8 oz of filtered water, coarse chop 1 whole banana and grab a Baggie of my Chocolate or Vanilla pre-measured powder and add it to my hand blender cup and blend it for about 30 seconds to make a delicious, super high protein drink!<br /><br />This product can be awesome for extended backpacking trips of 5-25 days where you can rarely consume enough calories or protein. Most menu plans provide lots of carbs and not so much protein.  For backpacking where you can burn 5,000+ calories a day, I would drink a double load for a quick breakfast drink using a shaker bottle but no fresh bananas of course.<br /><br />Great stuff, save a few bucks by subscribing and after trying it, you can always cancel your subscription if you find this product is not for you.<br /><br />I might try the Saco brand when I run out of the milk, just for comparison, but I cannot imagine that it could taste any better. I have tried other store brand instant non-fat dry milk that was fortified with vitamins A&D bot that gives that reconstituted milk the off flavor and smell.";"B000EDK67K";"B000EDK67K";"Bob's Red Mill Non Fat Dry Milk Powder, 22-ounce (Pack of 4)";"Bob's Red Mill";"powdered-milk";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EDK67K";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41VaAIPki6L._SL160_.jpg";"DAIRY_BASED_DRINK"

You actually recive THREE plants, not one, but mine arrived in a clump, growing together.  DO NOT TRY TO PRY THEM APART!!! they are supposed to come like this.<br /><br />Also, if you want a pot FULL of these plants, you just have to let them flower and produce seeds, and they flower so often and produce so many seeds that some growers consider this species as a weed as the baby plants colinize any pot they can grow in, and like i said before, they are pretty hard to perminately kill by carnivourous plant standards.<br /><br />I will update when major events happen (i.e.: The sundew changes color, ect)<br /><br />12/29/2011---'Stickly' is getting a ""tan""""(green turning red)";" and new dew drops are forming on his little tenticles";" and I fed each sundew (they are growing in a clump) a ant.""";"B0051S6U82";"B0051S6U82";"Carnivorous Spoon Leaf Sundew Drosera Spathulata Plant 3 inch pot";"JoelsCarnivorousPlants";"";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051S6U82"

It was nicely packed with a little less than twice as much potting material as the plant needed (so now I  have some extra :D).  It was very bunched up and quite small, and still is, so I'll post pictures when it looks more exciting.  It is quite green with little red-tipped hairs; from what I can gather if you want it to be as red as the picture you have to put it under grow lights.  When it came it was not dewy at all, but it had a little stock with what appears to be little seed pods, so I imagine it is a fairly mature plant if it is trying to reproduce.  I have been moving it to different windows around the house so it gets the most sun, but it went a couple days without getting any dew at all.  Today I tried putting a clear bowl over it to increase humidity, and now little drops of dew (digestive goo) are visible on some of the hairs.  This plant seems to be progressing so far, and it is 78-79 degrees F in here with a humidity of probably 40-50%.  It may or may not need a little help from a bowl for humidity, but other than that it seems just fine in a normal house on a window sill.

But, I like nutmeg and keep whole nutmegs to freshly grate into my baking, so I might not be the best to say it's not too overpowering.<br /><br />The first time I made these I didn't pay enough attention to the instructions. I figured hand mixing would probably be fine, and my batter was super thick. I made 'coffee cake' muffins with a layer of streusel inside, then a little on top. They completely caved in and while they actually tasted good they were a huge crumbly mess and had holes in the center.<br /><br />The second time I made them I did it exactly as instructed and they turned out great. I put in 1.5C of fresh blueberries and they did sink to the bottom. I found that to be too many as well, it was just a mouthful of blueberry in the lower half and no cake. Next time I'll just use fewer blueberries. But they rose well, stayed in one piece (so long as I was gentle with them, not for toddler hands), and tasted fantastic! I would say almost the same as gluteny muffins. They were light, airy, spongy, and delicious. I sprinkled the tops with a touch of plain white sugar just for fun.<br /><br />I'll make these again and again. I like not having to mix out a million flours and starches that are light as air and fly all over my kitchen when I make homemade recipes. So I'll take the convenience, I think King Arthur hit the mark on these!<br /><br />4/5 stars b/c if you follow the instructions, they are a total pain to make, to be honest, and b/c they don't really brown on top, take a little longer than expected to bake, and still have a tendency to crumble if you're not careful.

Melt some brie on these in the toaster oven. Wow.  I am waiting for the box of thirty on amazon but have regularly ordered the 30 pack on the bran crisp bread site, you pay around $2 per pack.  I keep these in my backpack for school or work and in the glove box of the car for handy use.  I love bringing them to the table at a restaurant for an alternative to bread.

They are utterly without taste.  The texture is pretty crisp and sturdy, and be prepared to do some chewing and wash them down with plenty of liquid least they utterly dry out your mouth and throat.<br /><br />  This might sound like a negative review so far, but I actually like these things.  Their lack of any flavor renders them absolutlely neutral in terms of whatever you want to top them with. At different times I've put hummus, cheese, nuttella, tuna salad and peanut butter on them to good effect.  The taste like whatever you top them with, period.  I wouldn't want to eat these things plain, but I really see no need to try.<br /><br />  As far as the fiber thing goes, well, I'll try to stay away from TMI territory, but they work very well.  If you have any troubles at all with constipation you can do away with them once and for all with this product.

They're yummy and satisfying and give me long-lasting energy all morning.  Since I'm always rushed in the morning, I put them in the pan at night and soak them in water.  I use more water than the directions call for (maybe about four times as much water as oats).  If you're going to add raisins, you can soak those right along with the oats.  Then in the morning I just turn the heat on, bring them to a boil, cover and turn down to the lowest simmer.  I like to cook them for 20 minutes, and they cook while I'm showering.  They don't need to be stirred at all as long as you keep the heat really low and use plenty of water.

Ants in Ripped Flour Bag";"I was excited when I ordered this yesterday and it was to be delivered today. I had almost everything I needed for the next phase in my diet, but the almond meal flour. After reading reviews and the ingredients I went ahead and ordered. I came home for the delivery only to find that ants were all in the box it was shipped in. Needless to say I was even more disgusted when I discovered the seam on the side of the bag was open and had not been sealed correctly and that the ants were all in the bag crawling around! The box was not left outside so no, it was not sitting waiting on me to get it. I immediately got online and had to initiate a return. If you do decide to order from this company, open the box outside and check the bag for bugs. I will not be ordering from them again. I will try to post an image later to show what I meant about the ants. I had to take the bag and put it in large ziplock gallon bags (two facing each other) and put it into the freezer until I can put it back in the box, seal it, and return to sender. I order a lot off amazon and this is the first thing I have ever had come to me with this problem. The ants may have come from an Amazon warehouse, or FedEx, but the poor quality control on the bag was from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted amazon through the chat and informed them about my concern about sending a bag with insects back to them. I also shared I had posted images on this product page. They said I could discard it and they would process my refund. I do say that I am and have always been happy with the fact Amazon backs up the products they ship and aim for good customer service.

I know it won't get as dough-like as wheat flour, but this was almost like cooked oatmeal, it was so runny.  So we ended up doubling the amount of flour, therefore, 2:1 ratio to regular flour, and the scones came out (a) crumbly and (b) salty.  I did add the regular amount of sugar to my recipe but it was apparently not enough to counteract the saltiness of the almonds.  Each of us choked down one scone with a lot of milk, and five more were tossed in the back yard for the birds.<br /><br />We will next attempt to make oatmeal-raisin cookies with it, and if that's as bad a fail, then we will not even bother with this product again.";"B0006ZN538";"B0006ZN538";"Honeyville Farms Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb";"Honeyville";"almond-flours";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006ZN538";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41-cYKFft5L._SL160_.jpg";"FLOUR"

There are 12 individually sealed packages in the box, and each package has about 20 super-thin seaweed snacks.  They're almost thin enough to read through, and the whole container only has 2 carbs, making them perfect for low-carb dieters.  They're surprisingly filling, and not overly salty.  They are extremely crispy and the entire package should be eaten soon after opening.  Humidity will make them gummy in just a short time.<br /><br />The nutrition information from Annie Chun's website says that each package of this sesame flavor has: 60 calories, 2 grams protein, 140 mg sodium, 5 grams of fat, 70% of daily vitamin A, 12% of daily vitamin C, and minerals (unnamed on the ingredients list).<br /><br />I like that these are all-natural and don't contain preservatives or food coloring.  I like that it's a novel way to eat vegetables, and that my kids love them. Next we'll try the wasabi flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that they use canola oil in them.  Canola oil is in so many foods we eat, and the process used to make it (hexane - a petroleum product, and high heat) causes it to produce free radicals in our body.  Free radicals are linked to obesity, heart disease and degenerative diseases in our bodies.  I would much prefer that all foods be made with cold-pressed oils like olive, peanut or sunflower oil.<br /><br />But canola oil aside, these seaweed snacks are delicious, filling, low carb, and we'll be buying them again.";"B003NUYBV8";"B003NUYBV8";"Annie Chun's Roasted Seaweed Snacks, Sesame, 0.35-ounce (Pack of 12), America's #1 Selling Seaweed Snacks";"Annie Chun's";"seaweed-snacks";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NUYBV8";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ebqHHAhmL._SL160_.jpg";"SNACK_CHIP_AND_CRISP"

After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.<br /><br />The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.<br /><br />There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.<br /><br />Made in Korea.<br /><br />If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com.

I have not noticed any type of offensive smells and I am normally disgusted and lose my appetite around fishy smells.<br /><br />The best part is that these snacks are actually nutritious.  I like that we're getting a 1/3 of Vit A daily needs from them.

I picked them up at Whole Foods, because if I hated them, I would not be stuck with 14 bags. Anway, these things are just large seaweed sheets cut up in bit size and so spicy, you can't eat them. I expected them in a chunky chip, because the magazine touted them as a very filling snack. You could never get filled up with these thin things and the spice and salt are just too much.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty).

I pretty much though I didn't like granola, but needed a snack and decided to give it a try. I originally bought it because it was the only granola I could find without any additives. Needless to say, I was AMAZED when I ate it! As other people have said, it is very fresh and the consistency is super, not hard, like most granolas. This makes the best yogurt parfaits. It's also good enough to just eat it alone, and you can't say that for the vast majority of granola.

I was forced to switch to this from the 72% when it became impossible to find the 72% locally (on my income, price is always important!)<br /><br />These are smooth, melt evenly and have a nice chocolate flavor without any significant other notes I can detect (your tastes may vary!)<br /><br />Americans have a problem with 'bitter' flavors--few US dishes use the bitter taste at all, and most Americans seem to feel that bitter equates to bad. Well, unsweetened cocoa is bitter, and it stays that way until you get to a fairly high level of added sweet.<br /><br />This means that high cocoa content chocolate is a taste that must be cultivated to some extent--how many coffee drinkers out there truly enjoyed their first cup? (Regular drinkers are addicted...enjoyment may come second to getting their fix.)<br /><br />My cookie recipe is based upon the Joy Of Cooking recipe, which I double everything EXCEPT the chocolate ships, and add 1/8 tsp red pepper (ground) and 1/4 tsp orange or lemon extract. These chips work quite well (though short of burning them, it's pretty hard to make a chocolate based dessert which I'd not eat...I even carried the infamous 'desert bars' for a few months in my car--slightly chocolate flavored wax is better than no chocolate at all....)<br /><br />For several months I went through 4-5 bags of these a week as snacks.<br /><br />The best chocolate is the one you personally like best.

WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?!";"If you like coffee, chocolate & crunchy cookies, I can give you my personal guarantee that YOU WILL LOVE THESE COOKIES!<br /><br />In 2004 I introduced a new cookie concept that was really my husband David's idea. Responding to requests to add cookies to our line-up of wholesale coffee shop desserts, I decided on a cookie that could be dipped in coffee (but not like biscotti). David jokingly suggested, ""why don't you just put the coffee into the cookie instead of dunking the  cookie into the coffee?"""" Mmmm";" not a bad idea";" I thought.<br /><br />But this proved to be easier said than done. The most challenging part was to get that """"just dipped in a latte"""" flavor";" that has now become our hallmark. Coffee flavoring was just too bitter. 14 months of experimenting later";" I formulated a specially designed wet cookie dough that would allow coarsely ground espresso beans to actually """"brew"""" into the cookies as they slowly baked. Finally! A chocolate chip cookie that truly tastes like you dunked it in a freshly brewed cup of French Roast coffee... soon named """"The Chocolate Chip Espresso"""".<br /><br />I then added different flavors to eventually produce a line of cookies that reads like the menu board in your favorite coffee shop:<br /><br />""""White Chocolate Vanilla Latte"""".

This is my new favorite morning tea.  The smell is simply DIVINE.  The berry does come through in taste, and the scent while putting the tea mug to your lips enhances the experience.  I try to steep it for about 5~7 minutes for a 16oz mug... although when I forget to take the teabag out, it really does not seem to get bitter at all (as many black teas do).  I drink it without sugar or milk (milk will negate the antioxidants in tea!) and it is neither bitter nor sweet.  The best way to get great flavor with black teas is to use BOILING water, not just hot.  Caffeine content is about what black tea should be: a little less than half a cup of coffee-- enough that I can drink 3 or 4 cups and not feel my eye twitching at the end of the day.  Really, I have quite a few kinds of tea in my cupboard and none of them match this one!  After trying this tea, I went back and bought three more boxes.

Our local stores in MI, still carry this flavor.  I was able to take advantage of a sale using coupons and got them for 25 cents a box at one store and free a week later at another store.....They are so delightfully delicious but I use a chocolate frosting on the cherry chip cakes to give it sort of a Black Forest type flavor.  I also use a whipped white frosting and add 2 teaspoons of almond extract to it, blend well, and frost my cherry chip cake with that for another awesome flavor variety. A third kids favorite is to frost the cake with a whipped white frosting that has a half pack of unsweetened cherry flavored Kool-Aid beaten in plus a few drops of red food coloring to make it pinkish in color.

I made macaroni and cheese with the rice macaroni for my grandson, and he loved it.<br /><br />One thing that I did notice is that it does seem to soak up more water in the cooking process, so I would suggest adding more water to the pan than you would normally use if you were cooking the wheat counterpart.  The first time I cooked the rice macaroni, the pan nearly ran dry of liquid before the macaroni was tender.  But don't worry, it does not come out mushy.

All of bionaturae pastas are excellent as well.<br /><br />After a little research on pasta there are some helpful hints that work with all types of pasta but are especially important with gluten free spaghetti.<br />Use as much water as your pot can hold, want good spaghetti, buy a bigger pot or use two pots that are appropriate for 6 ounces of pasta instead of 12 ounces.<br />*** Lots of water is vital to prevent spaghetti from sticking together.****<br />Too little water, the pasta becomes sticky as well as mushy.<br />NEVER add oil, I know it seems like a great idea but not only does not prevent spaghetti from sticking together but actually makes it more likely to occur.<br /><br />Adding salt to water is helpful but not necessary.<br /><br />Try adding your spaghetti very quickly, not slowly a few pieces at a time.  Again, it seems like a good idea but it promotes sticky & mushy pasta.  Why you ask?  Because all pastas gluten free and non gluten free release  a starchy substance that coats the pasta with in the first 2-3 minutes of being placed in boiling water.  This is commonly called glutinous starch but of course it is not the wheat, rye or barley protein gluten.  So adding individual strands prolongs this process of starch releasing and coating the strands of pasta increasing the likelihood of spaghetti stuck together. **** This is why is very, very important to use lots of water, and stir the pasta in the boiling water for the first 2-3 minutes to disperse the coating of sticky starch.****<br /><br />Then proceed with package directions on timing of pasta.  Of course I occasionally am distracted and boil the spaghetti noodles too long and am reward with mush.<br /><br />Best of Luck.<br /><br />PS my gluten free friend, Glutenfrieda is now making ice cream sandwiches that excellent.";"B001EQ4P00";"B001EQ4P00";"Bionaturae Spaghetti Gluten-Free Pasta | Rice and Lentil Spaghetti Pasta | Non-GMO | Lower Carb | Kosher | USDA Certified Organic | Made in Italy | 12 oz (6 Pack)";"bionaturae";"spaghetti-pasta";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EQ4P00";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pu6qb+kdL._SL160_.jpg";"NOODLE"

If you will be serving this to people not on a gluten free diet, I highly recommend this pasta, as most would not be able to tell the difference; it's just that good.";"B001EQ4P00";"B001EQ4P00";"Bionaturae Spaghetti Gluten-Free Pasta | Rice and Lentil Spaghetti Pasta | Non-GMO | Lower Carb | Kosher | USDA Certified Organic | Made in Italy | 12 oz (6 Pack)";"bionaturae";"spaghetti-pasta";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EQ4P00";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pu6qb+kdL._SL160_.jpg";"NOODLE"

But before you think most California short grain is the same, you need to try this or koshihikari.  If you don't want to spend $30 (locally sell here for around $25) then some stores sell them in small container for under $10.<br /><br />What's different about tamanishiki, koshihikari and other popular Japanese premium rice?  The grain is even shorter than regular short grain rice people are used to in the USA.  The texture is more 'plump' while the rice glitters with a very natural sweetness you don't normally get with regular American short-grain.  It has a very subtle bite on the outer layer.<br /><br />WASH your rice.  I don't know why this isn't stressed in the bag anywhere.  It's a standard procedure to wash the rice with cold water 3-4 times then fill the bowl and let the rice sit for 20 minutes.  If you're using a rice cooker you'll know this 20-minute wait time makes a difference.  I'll usually dump the water again and fill to the appropriate level and turn on the rice cooker.<br /><br />Try it for yourself though; the price will seem much cheaper when you eat these premium rice and why it's used at home and almost all Japanese sushi restaurants that offer quality sushi and dinner.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"""" or """"happy bowels"""" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I was looking for some nutritious additives, to help put fiber and ingredients that might be good for the heart and the rest of the body, such as lots of omega-3.  Research led me to flax seed, so off I went, to the store and found some.  I started adding it to my cereal for breakfast, my Carnation Instant Breakfast when that's breakfast, my homemade yogurt for my lunch time dessert, my ice cream (OK, an occasional treat that I generally avoid).<br /><br />I found that I like the stuff.  So, when I was getting near to running out of my first pound, instead of buying it at what to me seemed to be inflated prices I decided it was time to check Amazon.com.<br /><br />Wow, am I glad I did.  Four 16 oz bags cost about $5 more than one 16 oz container at the store. I used the subscribe and save option (which I also use for my tea), and it's $13.75 for 64 oz compared to $8 + for 16 at the store.  And this is good stuff.<br /><br />Also, I really like getting Bob's Red Mill because I really respect owner Bob Moore's plans to sell the company to his employees using an employee stock ownership plan.  A really neat thing to do.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this flaxseed meal?

It has a nice nutty flavor, the meal is ground to a nice consistency - not so large you need to chew it forever, not so small it turns into mush when wet. I add it to cold and hot cereals, pancakes, ice cream, puddings (great in vanilla pudding), yogurt, breads, cookies, cakes, tuna salad, scrambled eggs, real meat loaf and veggie meatloaf, veggie burgers & meatballs and more.<br /><br />Just be careful with men. I've read reports and articles that say too much flax seed can cause prostrate problems in men.<br /><br />I recommend keeping the entire bag in the freezer then opening it and taking only what you need when you need it. Since it's a ground grain-like texture it won't freeze into one large chunk so you will be able to take out small amounts at a time. I recommend keeping it in a glass container.

I'm not disappointed: the box was delivered very fast, and the kippers are great, mildly smokey with a good texture. Btw, I was on the fence initially whether to buy this kind -- because of the negative reviews here. I usually value critical reviews highly (and leave them myself whenever due), but I gotta say that these negative reviewers here must be smoking something good. One says, fish is loosely packed, soft and slimey in a lot of water. This is a lie: sizeable chunks of fish are packed very tightly; the texture is very nice; and there is maybe a tablespoon of salt water in a tin. Another says there's gluten in it. Wha? How did this come about? Gluten? In fish? I searched the tin for any mention of gluten, and, as expected, found nothing. Yet another einstein found soy in it. Again, where did you get this garbage about soy? I couldn't see anything about soy. It's fish and salt water. These guys must have been high, OK, good for them, but why post reviews in this blessed condition?<br /><br />Bottom line: perfect. If you like kippers, you'll like this version (and also, it's cheaper than buying in stores: round here, a comparable tin of kipper will be about two bucks.) I will certainly buy more.<br /><br />Update: I figured the reason the negative reviewers complained about gluten and soy: they confused this product with the same brand kippers in mustard sauce: I just ordered a box and, according to the ingredients list on the tins, _that_ product does have everything they complain about (because of the sauce).";"B000KHMWQS";"B000KHMWQS";"MW Polar Herring, Kipper Snacks, 3.53-Ounce (Pack of 18)";"MW Polar";"";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KHMWQS";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51j3wOHucJL._SL160_.jpg";"FISH"

Its shape and size makes Kipper an easy travel item, as with most other brands' cans, I suppose.  The scent of fish is strong, but typical of herring stored in this manner.  However, the smokey scent is not over powering and adds to the flavor: perfect.  As for the salt water, the amount of salt is light enough to complement the flavor of the fish, and not overwhelming, like other Kipper snack brands I will decline to mention.  The texture of the fish is good in that it is not too soggy, nor does it break up too easily, once removed from its solution.  To sum it up, these Kipper Snacks are a perfect blend of flavor.  No need to feel guilty here: Kippers also provide a healthy dose of omega 3 fatty acid, responsible for lowering triglycerides.

For years we have only eaten Brunswick Kippers but am having trouble finding them in area stores.  The last two cans we bought were different from what we always ate.  Watery, less flavor and odd pieces of fish.  I am especially impressed that Polar Kipper only has three ingredients, all of which we can pronounce and are familiar with.  We will be going on a subscription.  The can we opened did not even make it to a cracker!  Less smoky but the fish was cut into filets rather than mashed pieces and though salt was the only seasoning, it was not overwhelming.  Jewish Holidays are coming in September.

It has been years since I had Cheeze-Its, but I would have to say that this is as close as you can get to those shockingly orange snacks, in a gluten free cracker.  Unlike Cheeze-Its, these have a light airy taste and  a light natural color.  They are crisp, delicious and delightful.  They are puffy and cute like tiny elf hats, and aren't full of unpronounceable ingredients and they taste like real cheese.  They are just the right size to grab, and they have a satisfying taste and crunch.  The thing I really like is that they are delicious and satisfying enough that you won't feel like you need to eat the whole bag.  This is the first gluten free snack cracker that I have had, that I really liked and that's a good enough reason for me to buy them again!  The downside, as almost everyone has noted, is the packaging.  The top of the bag that I opened had very few broken crackers, but the middle and bottom were full of broken shards.  The box they came in was flimsy and crushed in spots.  This is an issue that the manufacturer needs to address.  There is no additional packaging: just six bags packed in a substandard box.  It looks like a display box, and should not have been used for shipping.  That little box should have been packed inside a heavier shipping box,  and had some kind of packing materials to help  prevent the breakage, or at least restrict it.  My box arrived two weeks after the estimated date, and almost a month after I first ordered it, so the next time I order these, I will know not to expect them until I see them.  The vendor couldn't have been nicer when I contacted them, and helped provide the tracking information for me.  I was happy with them and the product, and I will definitely purchase these again.  Definitely worth five stars, but I hope the next batch comes in a heavier box, and with fewer broken pieces.  With gluten free products, breaks are inevitable,  but with some forethought the breakage could be managed, or at least minimized.";"B004CWO9Y0";"B004CWO9Y0";"Wellaby's Cheese Ups Classic Cheese, 3-Ounce (Pack of 6)";"Wellaby's";"snack-puffs";"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004CWO9Y0";"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UC7h5RaFL._SL160_.jpg";"GROCERY"

I actually went online to make sure we followed the directions correctly. The cooking instructions on the packaging were difficult to read. The final product was soooo delicious. If one were to think that fiddle faddle is edible; this caramel corn ROCKS!! After cooking the popcorn, I would suggest doing the best you can to eliminate all of the kernels. Then cut the caramel into several pieces (we did 8) and then place them on top of the popcorn; which is in a microwave safe bowl. After about a minute more in the microwave, take out and mix well. Easy Peasy.

Only been able to find it on Amazon. Tip(for some reason the instructions on the box don't match the one on the package!) - pour the popped popcorn out into a microwave safe bowl. Then cut the caramel wafer up in to 6-8 pieces and scatter them on top of the corn, it will make it easier to mix once it's melted. be sure to watch it carefully but also to heat it long enough till it starts to just bubble a little bit! Then mix and enjoy. love love love it!
