Cheetos (111) ,Cheetos Crunchy ,https://www.taquitos.net/cheese_puffs/Cheetos_Crunchy,"Taste test: What does a Cheeto taste like? If you don't know, go out and buy some. It's the taste against which all other crunchy cheese flavored snacks are compared. Always look for the big Cheeto, (a.k.a. the Cheeto de Milo), the one with the extra big head that makes it extra crunchy.

The shape was reasonably fang-like, and the size was about an inch long, which was reasonable to use as fangs to hold up to your mouth.

(Frito-Lay gave us a similar mystery when they sold Ragin' Cajun & Tangy Ranch Zingers in dragon and non-dragon versions.)

This gives the snacker the option of going for the hot or cool flavor, or a combination, on any given mouthful.  As with the Sharp Cheddar & Salsa Picante flavor, the pieces were small, randomly shaped nuggets with a very nice crunch.","Smell test: Mostly ranch, not cajun, but really quite good.

Did this mean it was hotter (the Ragin' Cajun ones were already quite hot) or was it just a different bag featuring a fire-breathing Chester Cheetah on front?

Both colors were impressively bright. The Zingers came in all sorts of shapes and sizes, but on average they were about half an inch in their longest dimension.

It also provided a wider range of colors than the Cheezy version, offering a rare green Cheeto. As far as colors go, this was a very attractive mix, with a nice contrast between the four kinds: light orange, round and grid-filled Chipotle Cheddar pieces; bright orange Cheddar puffs; green Jalapeno Cheddar mini puffs; and dark red Salsa Picante crunchy curls.","Smell test: Kind of zesty, definitely some good hints of hot peppers.

The bag contained the same four kinds of Cheetos as the Xtra Cheezy Mix-Ups: standard crunchy ones and puffy ones (known as ""Double Cheddar Puffs""), plus stubby parmesan puffs and nacho cheese grids. The colors were also the same, at least out of the bag, with no purple in evidence.

We've also seen Chester Cheetah's face on bags of popcorn before, but it was labeled as Chester's Popcorn, with no mention of Cheetos anywhere on the bag.

It didn't look like the new logo was for the entire ""Jacked"" sub-brand, as the two other Jacked flavors, Enchilada Supreme and Smoky Chipotle BBQ, were next to this on the shelf, with the old logo.

Doritos (149) ,Doritos Jacked Spicy Street Taco ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Doritos-Jacked-Spicy-Street-Taco,"Taste test: This new product from Doritos wasn't really a new flavor, as it was just a new name for a flavor previously sold as Test Flavor: 855.

Doritos (149) ,Doritos Jacked Test Flavor: 2653 (Chocolate Chipotle Bacon) ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Doritos-Jacked-Test-Flavor-2653,"Taste test: This limited-edition Doritos bag hid its true flavor behind a code number, in conjunction with some contest. It was introduced alongside mystery flavors 855 (red bag) and 404 (yellow bag), bringing our Doritos review total to 106 varieties. The chips had the same oversized triangular shapes as the other Jacked flavors (Ranch Dipped Hot Wings, Smoky Chipotle BBQ and Enchilada Supreme), and the surfaces had generally a dull orange color, with some areas very dark orange. The chips had a rough texture, including some curvature and bubbles embedded inside most chips. We crunched in to find a strong, crisp crunch, with a surprisingly mild flavor. The initial taste was somewhat sweet, like maybe a mild cheese with some sweet pepper, but it was certainly not a ""Jacked"" level of flavoring. After that, we could taste mostly the toasted corn, which again seemed to be less than ""Jacked"" in flavor intensity. There was just a mild heat in the aftertaste, not much to speak of. Reasonably tasty, but there was nothing extreme here other than the very large size of the chips.","Smell test: Fairly intense, like a mix of taco powder and barbecue sauce.

Doritos (149) ,Doritos Jacked Test Flavor: 404 (Caribbean Citrus Jerk) ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Doritos-Jacked-Test-Flavor-404,"Taste test: This mystery Doritos flavor got a number instead of a descriptive name (as did 855 with a red label and 2653 with a blue one). The choice of the number 404 was a curious one, because it immediately brought to mind the Interweb's ""Not Found"" error. Flavor Not Found? Snack Not Found? We don't know. What we do know is that most of our snackers found these Doritos to be quite spicy and tasty. The chips had a dull orange color generally, with some areas more of a dull-and-dark orange thanks to lots of darker seasoning powder clumped on. They were also extra-extra large as triangular tortilla chips go. We crunched in to find a strong, solid crunch with a good crispness, plus a sweet, citrusy tropical fruit taste mixed into a chili pepper flavor. The lime in particular became even more noticeable in the aftertaste, as did the heat. A reasonably hot but not scary-hot flavor, quite tasty, a great mix of spices, sweetness and lime.","Smell test: Mildly spicy, but also kind of citrusy.

(The yellow 404 and blue 2653 bags didn't distract like this, as those colors aren't so closely tied to famous Doritos flavors.)","Smell test: Kind of like chili & lime chips, but with a bit of the typical Doritos smell mixed in.

But really, it was even more derivative than that. Half of the chips in this bag were just the regular Nacho Cheese flavor, which is the most popular, most readily available of all Doritos flavors, so it seems strange to make such a big deal out of it. Two flavors in one bag isn't even a new thing for Doritos, as they were selling ""Collisions"" flavors that do just that for several years until recently. In fact, one of those Collisions had taco in it: Zesty Taco Chipotle Ranch. Although half of the chips in this bag featured a new ""Crunchy Taco"" seasoning, recent years have seen a virtual parade of other taco flavors: Late Night Tacos at Midnight, Original Taco, (Un-original?) Taco, Taco (in retro bag) and Rollitos Zesty Taco. They even previously sold Taco Bell-flavored Doritos way back around 1994 (which was unfortunately before we started reviewing Doritos flavors).

First, as with many product lines at Costco, the selection is limited — usually they have just Nacho Cheese. Been there, done that. Second, Costco only sells Doritos in monstrously ginormous bags.

Doritos (149) ,Doritos Ultimate Cheddar ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Doritos-Ultimate-Cheddar,"Taste test: This new Doritos flavor jumped out as an oddity, because we've seen (and indeed eaten) it before. The story begins with the Blaze flavor that appeared in early 2018. This hot flavor was followed late in the same year by a Collisions version that combined Blaze with Ultimate Cheddar. That's where it got weird — at the time, there was no such flavor as Ultimate Cheddar, at least as a stand-alone flavor. It's hard to judge individual flavors in bags of Collisions, because some of the flavor rubs off on the other chips. But now — for a ""Limited Time Only"" — they're selling the Ultimate Cheddar in its own bag.

That's not to say that I wouldn't eat one if given the opportunity, but they're just a bit on the dry side as snack cakes go.

Drake's (4) ,Drake's Zoinks! ,https://www.taquitos.net/snack_cake/Drakes-Zoinks,"Taste test: This new knockoff of Twinkies from Drake's weighed in at 1.5 oz per piece, slightly more than the revived Twinkies brand with its 1.358-oz. cakes. Our first impression of these was based on the excellent ""Zoinks!"" name alone, which we assume they took from the favorite expression of Shaggy Rogers from Scooby Doo (despite the lack of anything Scooby or Shaggy-related on the box). The taste was pretty much the same as Twinkies, quite good. The texture was nice too, spongy and soft with a good amount of creme. The balance of creme filling to cake seemed to be a bit more on the cake side with Zoinks vs. Twinkies, but it was still just fine with us.","Smell test: Very nice, sweet and creamy without being too sweet.

Goldfish (28) ,Goldfish Puffs Buffalo Wing ,https://www.taquitos.net/cheese_puffs/Goldfish-Puffs-Buffalo-Wing,"Taste test: Having had much experience eating Goldfish, I was quite intrigued when I spotted Goldfish Puffs at my local supermarket. Puffs? Did that means they'd be really big? That they were more like cheese puffs? The large bag dwarfed the standard Goldfish bags, so I was thinking big as I opened the bag. I peered inside to find that they were actually about the same size as the cracker fish and had a similar orange color, but they looked quite different. Most pieces were thicker, the fishes' mouths were more pronounced (cut away rather than just indented into the snack) and the tails had a different shape. But the really important difference was the ingredients, as these were made from corn meal instead of wheat.","Smell test: Like a Buffalo wing sauce, but pretty ,ild.

It showed up a week after three other musically themed Lay's flavors (Flamin' Hot Dill Pickle Remix, Classic Beer Cheese and Electric Lime & Sea Salt) and had the same music-related promotional material on the bag — but it wasn't marketed along with the other three.

They seem to be doing things a bit differently this year.

In the last round, it was Chicken & Waffles. For Walkers (the British version of Lay's) it was Cajun Squirrel.

Lay's (224) ,Lay's Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Lays-Cheddar-Bacon-Mac-and-Cheese,"Taste test: This entry in the Lay's Do Us A Flavor contest was much anticipated, as mac & cheese is a favorite comfort food for many, and everything's better with bacon! (Competing flavors in the contest are Cappuccino, Wasabi Ginger and Mango Salsa.) The chips had somewhat wiggly shapes and were light yellow with an orange glow in many areas, plus some smallish black specks scattered unevenly over the surfaces. We crunched in to find a tasty but mild cheddar taste that wasn't all that different from a lot of other cheese-flavored potato chips. There was a hint of something bacon-like, on the weak side, strong enough to alter how the cheese tasted but not nearly strong enough to really taste like someone put bacon in my mac & cheese. It was a good taste, fairly mild, but not a real close match for the highly craved flavor in the name.","Smell test: Mild cheddar smell, with maybe a hint of smoke but not really bacon.

But we later realized that the flavor that we reviewed back in 2007 was Jalapeño Cheddar, not Cheddar Jalapeño, so we'll go along and count this as a new flavor.","Smell test: Very strong tangy cheddar smell, not specifically like jalapeno, but the spices really helped to bring out the cheese.

M&M's (54) ,Kudos 100 Calorie M&M's Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Kudos-100-Calorie-MMs-Bar,Taste test: This small snack bar consisted mostly of crisp rice and mini-M&M's.,Smell test: Smells like M&M's ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M-Azing Crunchy Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/snacks.php?snack_code=2419,Taste test: This M-Azing chocolate bar is definitely one of the cooler-looking candy bars to come along in a while (as is its similar-looking peanut butter cousin).,Smell test: An OK chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M-Azing Peanut Butter Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/snacks.php?snack_code=2342,Taste test: The weird thing about this is that it's a chocolate candy bar with peanut butter-flavored M&M's inside it. Peanut butter M&M's? I thought that M&M's were by definition made from chocolate. (They also make a chocolate-in-chocolate version that uses conventional M&M's.),Smell test: Very nice chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's White BOO-tterscotch ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Butterscotch,"Taste test: This seasonal version of M&M's came in three different colors shells — yellow, tan and a very slightly pinkish off-white — with gray M's on all three kinds. Many of the recent limited-edition M&M's were build around the original Milk Chocolate formula, with in most cases subtle changes in flavor from there, but they were more ambitious here, promising a white chocolate base.","Smell test: Wow, really smells like butterscotch!

M&M's (54) ,M&M's Bar Milk Chocolate with Minis & Peanuts ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Bar-Milk-Chocolate-Minis-Peanuts,"Taste test: This bar had the same impressive section design as the Crisp Rice and original versions, this time with peanuts within the chocolate in addition to miniature versions of M&M's. As with the others, there were some of the colorful M&M's showing through the top, but not a lot of them. There were some peanuts showing through the bottom of the bar, but again, not a lot.",Smell test: Smells a like like Peanut M&M's. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's Cafe Mocha ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Cafe-Mocha,"Taste test: These M&M's came in just green and red, and with the promise of mocha flavor, we were eager to try them. However, there was some disappointment when we did, as they tasted a whole lot like regular Milk Chocolate M&M's. We shared them with lots of snackers, and people generally noticed just a hint of coffee amid the chocolate, if any. No major complaints, as they still satisfied the chocolate craving, but we would hope that a mocha flavor would have a more even mix of coffee and chocolate.",Smell test: Very much like standard Milk Chocolate M&M's but maybe hint of coffee. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's Caramel ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Caramel,"Taste test: These M&M's came in standard M&M's colors — orange, yellow, brown, green, blue and red — but the pieces were noticeably larger than the originals. Many of the M's inked onto the surfaces seemed to be a bit off center. I carefully bit off half of my first piece to get a look at the cross-section. The vast majority of the interior consisted of caramel, with a thin chocolate layer between that and the colored shell. The caramel part had a chewy feel that was quite unusual for M&M's. That chewiness made the light crunch of the shell more noticeable. The mix of chocolate and caramel was good.",Smell test: Good caramel and chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's Chocolate Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Chocolate-Bar,"Taste test: Some years back, M&M's sold the M-Azing Bar in peanut butter and crunchy versions. Neither was much of a standout in terms of taste, but they both looked really nice, as the glow of the colored mini-M&M's inside a chocolate bar was visually stunning. So of course, they stopped selling those. We recently spotted this, which looked to be a revival of the same concept, though in this case they didn't promise peanut butter or crunches, just milk chocolate.",Smell test: Mild milk chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's Cookies & Screeem ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Cookies-and-Screeem,"Taste test: These M&M's had textured patterns on their surfaces unlike any we've seen on M&M's since the demise of the Premiums M&M's sub-brand. They didn't glow quite the way the Premiums did, but they did have an impressive look. Some of the pieces did, anyway — the texture was very pronounced on about half of them and subtle on the others. Those with lots of texture had lots of smattered light spots or even a domination of light spots on the generally dark surfaces, not quite a black-and-white look as pictured on the bag, as the tints of the light areas varied from one piece to the next. Those with less texture had minimal, smaller light spots.","Smell test: Mostly dark chocolate, but probably some white mixed in too. Nice.

M&M's (54) ,M&M's Holiday Mint ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Holiday-Mint,"Taste test: These M&M's came in white, green and red colors, with gray M's on all three kinds. The sizes of the pieces varied more than I've generally seen with M&M's. Was this really a new ""Holiday Mint"" flavor, or the same as the ones previously labeled Mint Chocolate with a new name and bag design? It's hard to say for sure, as there were similarities and difference — same three colors of the pieces, but a different color for the M's.",Smell test: Sharp mint and chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7

M&M's (54) ,M&M's Mega ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-M-Mega,"Taste test: This new version of M&M's didn't attempt to stand out with a new flavor or special color, but instead it boasted increased size, claiming that each piece had three times as much chocolate as your usual M&M's. We ripped open the bag to find that they were indeed bigger. Each piece had about the same diameter as a nickel. But that's still not a particularly big snack, so Mega sounded a bit overstated. The M's printed on the surfaces were the same size as the ones on regular M's. That seemed like a poor choice. A larger M, proportional to the larger M&M — like the one in the Mega logo on the bag — might have reinforced the Mega look. Instead, the small M looked lost amid the large surface.",Smell test: Regular M&M's smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7
M&M's (54) ,M&M's Milk Chocolate Bar with Minis ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Milk-Chocolate-Bar,"Taste test: I was a big fan of the M-Azing Bar, more for how it looked than how it tasted, and I've long lamented the fact that it got discontinued.

M&M's (54) ,M&M's Milk Chocolate Bar with Minis & Crisp Rice ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/M-and-Ms-Milk-Chocolate-Bar-Minis-Crisp-Rice,"Taste test: The bar had the same clever design as the M&M's Milk Chocolate Bar with Minis one, with 20 regular sections bearing a round M&M's logo, plus an M&M's character spanning all four rows and three virtual columns of extra-wide sections — the only difference being that this time, they added Rice Krispies in addition to mini M&M's within the chocolate.",Smell test: Nice creamy milk chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=grocery&field-keywords=M&M's&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=32226b2fa02b5a378ad53f5b13112ac7

M&M's (54) ,M&M's Premiums Triple Chocolate ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/MMs_Premiums_Triple_Chocolate,"Taste test: The first question upon encountering this oddly shaped cardboard box was how to open it. One of the concave sides sort of folded out after ripping some glue, revealing a clear plastic bag that held the M&M's. (I later discovered that if I had first slid the inner box out of its slip case, a pull tab near the top provided easy access to the interior.) The M&M's looked quite a bit different than conventional M&M's. They were bigger, and each piece did not have a uniform color, both rather a marble-like mix of colors, with sort of a metallic glow. The overall color of each piece was generally a dark purple, but the brightness and shade varied from one piece to the next.","Smell test: Very nice.

The pieces came in three colors — white, green and kind of a brownish red. The picture on the package showed all three kinds being quite shimmery, even a bit metallic in the case of green and red/brown.

I grabbed a handful and bit in to find the usual M&M's texture and a flavor that was very much like the taste of a pumpkin pie. The interiors had an off-white color.

Oreos (151) ,Apple Pie Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Apple-Pie,"Taste test: This latest limited-edition Oreo flavor promised a taste as American as apple pie. In fact, it actually promised the taste of apple pie! The cookies had a color similar to Golden Oreos, though the package said they were graham-flavored, and the filling wasn't too far off from the cookies in color, but it kind of looked like peanut butter.","Smell test: Reminds me of some apple snacks, but very graham cracker-like, so not a real match for apple pie.

Can't they just let us enjoy our summer without reminding us about school? But I guess if you're going to remind me about school, it might as well be on the outside of an Oreo that I'm eating.",Smell test: The usual Oreos smell.

Oreos (151) ,Baskin-Robbins Mint Chocolate Chip Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Baskin-Robbins-Mint-Chocolate-Chip-Oreo,"Taste test: This ice cream shop-themed version of Oreos, based on my favorite flavor, had the usual Oreo chocolate cookies enclosing a two-tone creme filling — one layer green with tiny brown spots, the other all brown. The alignment of the two layers varied a bit from one cookie to the next, as both colors didn't consistently extend all the way to the edge (as was pictured on the wrapper), leaving some parts of the exposed filling all-green or all-brown.","Smell test: Really good, like a lot of other chocolate and mint cookies.

Oreos (151) ,Berry Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Berry-Oreo,"Taste test: Based on the package graphics, this Oreo flavor seemed to promise a filling that combined both raspberry and strawberry. However, neither berry was named anywhere on the wrapper, as the actual words said only ""Berry"" and we couldn't find any kind of berry at all listed in the ingredients. We opened the package to find kind of a pink/light purple filling in between the chocolate cookies, about the same as the color shown on the package.","Smell test: Smells just like Mixed Berry yogurt.

Oreos (151) ,Blueberry Pie Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Blueberry-Pie-Oreo,Taste test: This highly anticipated version of Oreos used the same graham cracker-flavored cookies as the S'mores and Key Lime Pie ones while adding a lavender-colored filling to bring on the blueberry.,"Smell test: Mostly smells like graham crackers, but also a hint of blueberry on the second whiff.

Oreos (151) ,Brownie Batter Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Brownie-Batter,"Taste test: This limited edition of Oreos was dark. Very dark. The picture on the wrapper showed a dark brown filling between the nearly-black Oreo cookies, but when I opened the package, the brownie batter filling looked actually just about equally as dark as the cookies. The lack of contrast between the cookies and the filling gave them kind of a strange, un-Oreo-like look.",Smell test: Very intense chocolate smell.

Oreos (151) ,Cadbury Dairy Milk Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Oreo,"Taste test: This chocolate bar had seven domed sections with a nice curvy appearance. Atop each section was neither a Cadbury logo nor an Oreo one, but instead some squiggly lines that vaguely resembled the ""Dynamic Ribbon"" from Coke's logo. From the outside, the surface looked mostly like milk chocolate, but there were a few darker areas that we figured came from the Oreo bits within.","Smell test: Good chocolate smell, but couldn't really notice any Oreo.

Oreos (151) ,Caramel Apple Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Caramel-Apple-Oreo,"Taste test: This limited edition of Oreos took two Golden Oreo cookies for the exterior and then split the filling between a green apple half and a light brownish caramel. We offered these with lots of snackers, and most were eager to try them. Those who did were about equally split between fans who thought the combination tasted just like a caramel apple and detractors who though that the apple tasted fake, the caramel tasted fake, and the combination tasted bad. This was a sharp contrast to the universally praise that folks had for the Pumpkin Spice Oreos.","Smell test: Smells like fake caramel and fake apple, but not really like a caramel apple.

Oreos (151) ,Caramel Coconut Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Caramel-Coconut,"Taste test: We've reviewed several coconut-flavored Oreos — Fudge Cremes Coconut Delight, Coconut Thins and Thins Bites Fudge Dipped Coconut Creme — and one thing they all had in common was that none of them contained any actual coconut (another thing being that that all all really did taste like coconut). That isn't necessarily a bad thing, since I find the texture of coconut to be the worst aspect of it.","Smell test: More caramel than coconut. Really, barely any coconut.

Oreos (151) ,Carrot Cake Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Carrot-Cake-Oreo,"Taste test: This striking flavor of Oreo was labeled as ""New!"" but the package didn't mention anything about being a limited edition. However, considering how long some of the Limited Editions stick around and how flavors generally come and go, maybe it's not a meaningful distinction.","Smell test: Yeah, it really smells like carrot cake.

Oreos (151) ,Celebrate Mickey Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Celebrate-Mickey-Oreo,"Taste test: This limited-edition Oreo, created to celebrate 90 years of Mickey Mouse, featured a rotation of three Mickey-related designs on one face of each sandwich, with the other side bearing the standard Oreo markings.",Smell test: Smells like birthday cake frosting. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Cherry Cola Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Cherry-Cola-Oreo,"Taste test: Even with lots of new limited Oreo flavors hitting the market over the past year (including Kettle Corn), this one was far more ambitious than most — attempting not just the taste of cola, but cherry cola, and not just that flavor, but also incorporating the popping sensations that first came to the Oreo line with Firework Oreo. Like many other Oreo products, they didn't license the famous Cherry Coke name here, just going with a generic version.",Smell test: Smells like cola. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Choco Chip Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Choco-Chip-Oreo,"Taste test: This special flavor of Oreos came in the same small 10.7-oz. package as other recent limited editions, but there was something brand new about this one — the cookies. Rather than reusing an existing cookie and just making a new filling, it looked like they started with Golden Oreo cookies and added small bits/streaks of chocolate within them. It didn't give the appearance of chocolate chip cookies, but rather it was an odd, irregular look. The creme filling had a slightly brownish off-white color, plus there were small bits of chocolate in the creme.","Smell test: Kind of Oreo like, but not entirely, as there is a strong hint of chocolate chip cookie.

Oreos (151) ,Chocolate Creme Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Chocolate-Creme-Oreo,"Taste test: When we reviewed the new Dark Chocolate Oreos, it seemed appropriate to compare them against this longtime flavor — until we realized we'd neglected to actually review these. So it's time to formally do that.","Smell test: A lot like original Oreos, as you can still smell the creme and not just the chocolate, but probably a bit more chocolatey.

Oreos (151) ,Chocolate Hazelnut Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Chocolate-Hazelnut-Oreo,"Taste test: These limited-edition Oreos put a Nutella-like filling in between two Golden Oreo cookies, but the Oreo folks conspicuously avoided using the word Nutella anywhere on the package. This is consistent with the past tendency of Oreo not to license well-known brands when incorporating their flavors into limited-edition Oreos — witness the ""Not Rice Krispies Treats"" Marshmallow Crispy Oreo, ""Not Fruity Pebbles"" Fruity-Crisp Oreo, ""Not Red Hots"" Hot & Spicy Cinnamon and ""Not Cinnabon"" Cinnamon Bun. (Three notable exceptions were Dunkin' Donuts, Swedish Fish and DQ Blizzard flavors.)","Smell test: Very mild, but kind of like Nutella.

Oreos (151) ,Chocolate Marshmallow Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Chocolate-Marshmallow,"Taste test: For years, we've documented the ever-smaller package sizes for limited-edition Oreos, but it seems that the new decade has brought real change to the Oreo brand, as this one was not only not smaller than a regular Oreos package — it was actually bigger, upping the weight from the standard 15.25 ounces to the family-size 17 oz. (It actually wasn't described on the package as a limited edition, a label that Oreo seems to be moving away from, as they simply proclaimed ""New!"" on this one.)","Smell test: Kind of marshmallowy, definitely different from standard Oreos.

Oreos (151) ,Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Pie-Oreo,"Taste test: This wasn't the first time we've seen both chocolate and peanut butter in an Oreo, nor even the second for that matter, as we've reviewed both the Peanut Butter and Reese's versions. However, there was one very essential difference with this one, as the sandwich was enclosed in graham cracker-flavored cookies instead of chocolate ones — and the result was extremely tasty. The filling was split down the middle between chocolate and peanut butter (just like the Reese's version), and the combination of those fillings and the cookies was pretty awesome, a great match for the taste of a peanut butter pie. It was even better with some cold milk.","Smell test: Way more PB than chocolate, and really good.

Oreos (151) ,Chocolate Strawberry Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Chocolate-Strawberry,"Taste test: These special Oreos kept the conventional chocolate cookies while replacing the white creme with a mix of chocolate creme (around the edges) and strawberry creme (in the center). The chocolate creme had a fairly light brown color, or at least it looked light against the nearly black cookies. The pink strawberry creme wasn't visible without biting into or peeling open a sandwich.","Smell test: More chocolate than strawberry, but a very nice mix.

Oreos (151) ,Cinnamon Bun Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Cinnamon-Bun-Oreo,"Taste test: This special version of Oreos had a white filling and beige color to the cookies, but the beige was not a consistent color, as there were darker spots here and there.",Smell test: Kind of a vanilla-heavy cinnamon smell.

Oreos (151) ,Cookie Butter Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Cookie-Butter,"Taste test: I first encountered the concept of Cookie Butter at Trader Joe's when they started selling Speculoos Cookie Butter. I had no idea what it was, but I had to try, and when I did, I ended up eating quite a few spoonfuls of it straight from the jar. It had a texture similar to peanut butter, and was just as spreadable and came in both crunchy and smooth versions. I don't think I ever actually spread it onto anything — right off the spoon with milk worked great. When TJ's introduced a sandwich cookie filled with their cookie butter, I liked it just as much.","Smell test: Strong sweet smell, with lots of vanilla and maybe a hint of cinnamon.

Oreos (151) ,Cookie Crusted Almonds made with Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/nuts/SunTree-Oreo-Crusted-Almonds,"Taste test: These coated almonds had almond-like shapes, except bigger, thanks to a two-layer coating, with Oreo creme immediately coating the almond, then a finely crushed Oreo cookie coating over that. The outside was a dark grayish color.","Smell test: Mild Oreo cookie smell, with definitely the creme part noticeable.

Oreos (151) ,Cookie Dough Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Cookie-Dough-Oreo,"Taste test: This version of Oreos had the standard designs for the round cookies enclosing the sandwich, but in between there was a light brown filling, supplied a bit more generously than the standard white, though the filling thickness varied from sandwich to sandwich. The filling was darker in color than it showed in the illustration on the package, as it was more of a light brown than a beige. At first it looked like the filling was uniform in color, but when I pulled open a few sandwiches, I found that there were some darker areas of the filling (presumably representing the ""chocolatey chips"" promised on the package, but really they were not chips).","Smell test: Smells kind of like Oreos, but not quite, probably because of the different filling, but not really much like cookie dough.

Oreos (151) ,Double Stuf Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Double-Stuf-Oreo,"Taste test: This isn't a new product by any stretch, but it's one that we're way overdue in reviewing. We did our due diligence in reviewing the even-more-than-Double-Stuf Mega Stuf Oreo a few years back, as well as the Mint Creme version of the Double, but this one existed many years earlier. In fact, long before the days of countless varieties of Oreos, I believe the Double Stuf was the first-ever addition to the Oreo product line. Back when Oreos were persistently advertised with the Ice cold milk and an Oreo cookie jingle — which included the words ""The one and only, creamy, crunchy, chocolate O-R-E-O"" — they eventually had to add an extra (extremely self-contradictory) verse at the end, noting that ""Oreo and Oreo with Double Stuf, it really is the one and only!""",Smell test: Nice!

Oreos (151) ,Dunkin' Donuts Mocha Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Dunkin-Donuts-Mocha,"Taste test: Not long after Pop-Tarts rolled out two Dunkin' Donuts flavors (Frosted Chocolate Mocha and Vanilla Latte), these coffee-themed Oreos promised to deliver the flavor of a mocha beverage from Dunkin' Donuts in Oreo form. Each sandwich appeared to have the same chocolate cookies as the regular Oreos, but their filling was a very light brown rather than the usual white. The cookies had standard Oreo markings — no Dunkin' Donuts logo or anything.",Smell test: Smells like regular Oreos.

One face of each sandwich had a fairly typical Oreo design, except modified for the not-round shape, while the opposite side rotated among four different Easter designs, the same ones used in 2019.","Smell test: Fairly sweet, just like Golden Oreos.

Oreos (151) ,Filled Cupcake Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Filled-Cupcake,"Taste test: This new flavor generated a lot of excitement, as the promise seemed to be that they would taste like a Hostess Cupcake. They used the usual chocolate Oreo cookies with standard markings, and the outwardly visible filling was a medium brown, dark but quite a bit lighter than the cookies.

Oreos (151) ,Football Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Football_Oreo,"Taste test: For this version of Oreos, Nabisco rotated through four designs (a football, a quarterback throwing a football, a helmet and an X's and O's diagram) for one cookie in each sandwich and used the standard Oreo markings on the other one. They also doubled the creme filling — an extra bonus not mentioned on the package.",Smell test: Regular Oreo smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Football Shaped Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Football-Shaped-Oreo,"Taste test: A few years back, Nabisco brought us the original Football Oreos as round Oreos with football-related designs on one cookie out of each sandwich. This product had the same ""Football Oreo"" name on the package, but it wasn't the same, as they went one better and made the cookies in the shape of a football.",Smell test: Normal Oreos smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Fruity Crisp Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Fruity-Crisp-Oreo,"Taste test: The limited-edition Oreos keep getting weirder, and this one certainly followed that trend. It essentially promised a creme filling with bits of colorful Fruity Pebbles cereal in between two Golden Oreo cookies. Although everything on the package closely resembled Fruity Pebbles, it appears that the folks at Oreo/Nabisco/Mondelez didn't want to pony up the dough to use the actual trademark, hence the odd ""Fruity Crisp"" name. (This is much like the lack of the Rice Krispies Treats name for the Marshmallow Crispy Oreos.)","Smell test: Very sweet and fruity, a lot like Fruity Pebbles.

Oreos (151) ,Fudge Covered Oreo Dark Chocolate ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Fudge-Covered-Dark-Chocolate,"Taste test: This box contained 12 sandwiches, similar in concept to the Fudge Covered Oreo and Fudge Covered Oreo Mint Creme, but in this case, they changed both the creme and coating to be dark chocolate-flavored. The coating didn't look super dark, maybe a hint darker than the non-dark chocolate ones.","Smell test: Very mild, not really like dark chocolate.

Oreos (151) ,Fudge Covered Oreo Mint Creme ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Fudge-Covered-Oreo-Mint-Creme,"Taste test: When I spotted this in the cookie aisle, it looked on first glance like just a mint variation of the Fudge Covered Oreo that we reviewed four months earlier. But after noticing some odd fine print on the box — specifically: ""enlarged to show details, serving size 1 cookie"" — I became curious. The part before the comma is fairly standard stuff on all food packaging, and the last part is nothing unusual in these days of portion sizing. But combining them together, separated by a comma, was downright weird. Are they required to have a disclaimer simply for having pictured two cookies on the box? Is this about preempting frivolous lawsuits? I don't know!","Smell test: Good chocolate mint smell, but not the amazing sensation that combinations like this usually provide.

Oreos (151) ,Gingerbread Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Gingerbread-Oreo,Taste test: This limited-edition Oreo (available only at Target as far as we know) used the lightly colored Golden Oreo cookies to enclose a filling with a color closer to Ginger Snaps.,Smell test: Strong gingerbread smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Golden Oreo Fudge Cremes with Birthday Cake Creme ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Golden-Oreo-Fudge-Cremes-Birthday-Cake,"Taste test: These cookies followed the same basic formula as the other Oreo Fudge Cremes (original, Peanut Butter and Mint): a single cookie with creme on one side, covered in fudge.","Smell test: Wow, they really do smell like a birthday cake.

Oreos (151) ,Golden Oreo Mega Stuf ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Golden-Oreo-Mega-Stuf,"Taste test: Much like the non-golden Oreo Mega Stuff, this beige-and-white version had more ""stuf"" between the two cookies than a double-stuf Oreo, but really not that much more, and not nearly enough to justify the use of the word Mega. We've reviewed lots of variations of the Oreo cookie, including a Golden version of the Fudge Cremes with birthday cake filling and chocolate fudge coating, but until this, we'd so far avoided the plain, chocolate-free Golden ones.","Smell test: Strong, sweet vanilla smell.

We've already reviewed the Mega Stuf Golden ones, Golden Thins and Golden Fudge Cremes with Birthday Cake Creme, but this simpler Golden Mini was a new one.

Oreos (151) ,Good Humor Strawberry Shortcake Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Good-Humor-Strawberry-Shortcake,"Taste test: This limited-edition Oreo was based on the popular ice cream bar, delivering a strawberry filling between two specially modified Golden Oreo cookies (more on those later). This marked the second time we're aware of that Oreo attempted to match a particular ice cream treat, the previous being a DQ Blizzard version.","Smell test: Strong sweet strawberry smell, a good match for the Good Humor bar.

Oreos (151) ,Hot & Spicy Cinnamon Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Cinnamon-Hot-Spicy,"Taste test: These Oreos looked much like the Winter Oreos, with the same red-colored filling (but without the winter-themed cookie designs), yet this one promised to bring a spicy cinnamon flavor along with the red, rather than Winter Oreo's ""same great taste."" The package showed what appeared to be a bunch of Red Hots, arranged into the shape of a heart. As a fan of spicy cinnamon things, especially Hot Tamales, this sounded great to me, and I was eager to see how the spicy cinnamon taste would combine with chocolate.","Smell test: Good cinnamon candy smell, but you really have to hold the cookies close to your nose to notice it.

Oreos (151) ,Hot Cocoa Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Hot-Cocoa,"Taste test: These Oreos used a noticeably different formula than some other limited editions that split a single filling layer into two types (like Candy Corn Oreo, PB&J Oreo or Jelly Donut Oreo), as this one instead had two thinner layers stacked on top of each other. Depending on which way you hold the cookie, it was a white layer over a brown layer, or the other way around.","Smell test: Definitely different from regular Oreos, and probably because of the inclusion of chocolate creme, but it didn't really smell like hot chocolate.

Oreos (151) ,Jelly Donut Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Jelly-Donut-Oreo,"Taste test: These limited-edition Oreo sandwiches promised to taste like jelly donuts, and the creme filling was even designed to look like them. From the outside, each one looked like a Golden Oreo, but within the white-edged filling was a dark purplish center.","Smell test: Not really like a donut, but could definitely smell some jelly fruitiness in addition to the Golden Oreo aroma.

Oreos (151) ,Kettle Corn Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Kettle-Corn-Oreo,"Taste test: These Oreos were released alongside two other surprising flavors, Cherry Cola and Piña Colada, for the first Oreo flavor contest that we're aware of. The sandwiches had the same beige cookies as Golden Oreos, with a filling that was off-white. I crunched in to find a nice sweet flavor, vaguely maple-like, but not anything like kettle corn. For a good kettle corn, I expect a light sweetness along with some saltiness. I liked the taste and level of sweetness here, but it was too sweet for kettle corn, and the saltiness was absent.","Smell test: Mostly like Golden Oreos, but sweetened with some maple, but really not anything like popcorn or kettle corn.

Oreos (151) ,Marshmallow Crispy Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Marshmallow-Crispy-Oreo,"Taste test: There were a few very odd things about this limited-edition flavor of Oreos. First was their announcement/release schedule. In January 2014, the Oreo folks got a lot of buzz when they announced two special flavors, this one and Cookie Dough. We managed to get the Cookie Dough Oreos the next month, but these have been nowhere to be found during a year and half of searching (and we do look in many cookie aisles — often — for new versions of Oreos). That's very odd. (In fact, it was such a long gap of time that Oreo had shrunk the standard size of their limited-edition packaging from 12.2 oz. for Cookie Dough to 10.7 oz. for these, so the two flavors announced together didn't even match.)","Smell test: Not exactly like Rice Krispies Treats, but somewhat close.

One odd thing about the other was that the wrapper inside the box appeared to meet all of the requirements to be the outer packaging, but in three different languages than the box) It wasn't that way for this one — the inner foil tube wrapper had a whole bunch of Oreo logos (just ""Oreo"" — not ""Mildly Sweet Oreo"") and nothing else, so it probably wouldn't meet labeling requirements in the absence of the box.","Smell test: Definitely less intense than the standard Oreos, but not qualitatively different.

Oreos (151) ,Milka Double Chocolate Oreo Chocolate Candy Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Milka-Double-Chocolate-Oreo,"Taste test: This bar followed a similar formula to the Milka & Oreo bar, with a 5x3 section grid, a milk chocolate exterior and an interior consisting of Oreo creme and bits of Oreo cookie. The ""Double Chocolate"" difference was that the creme was chocolate-flavored instead of the conventional white creme.

Oreos (151) ,Milka Mint Oreo Chocolate Candy Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Milka-Mint-Oreo-Milk-Chocolate-Bar,"Taste test: This narrow bar had the same shape and six-section design as the non-mint version, and it's now one of four different versions of the Milk Oreo bar (the other two being Big Crunch and the original Milka & Oreo).",Smell test: Great mint chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Milka Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Milka-Oreo,"Taste test: This was the eighth kind of Oreo-themed Milka chocolate bar that we've reviewed, but it was the first to embed entire Oreo cookies (albeit miniature ones) into the bar. The bar had 10 sections, lined up in two rows of five, with the round Mini Oreo cookies and a layer of creme rising up from the top and just the cookies jutting out of the bottom.

Oreos (151) ,Milka Oreo Big Crunch Bar ,https://www.taquitos.net/candy/Milka-Oreo-Big-Crunch-Bar,"Taste test: This bar was by far the largest of the three new Oreo-themed candy bars released by Milka, weighing in at 10.5 ounces and containing 36 sections in a 9x4 grid. After finding the other two (the small Oreo Chocolate Candy Bar and midsize Milka & Oreo) had far more creme than cookie, with bits of Oreo cookie within a white creme center — and not even the real Oreo creme filling, at that — I was excited to see that this one showed a solid cookie layer in between creme layers.

Oreos (151) ,Mystery Oreo 2017 ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Mystery-Oreo,"Taste test: Unlike some of the limited-edition Oreos that get lots of prerelease buzz before we can find any, this one just popped up out nowhere. And oh, boy did it pop up! Lots of stores suddenly had huge, not-so-limited supplies. And they even packaged them in the same 15.25-oz. packages as original Oreos, rather than the 10.7-oz. ones that have been used lately for limited editions.","Smell test: Very sweet, like Fruity Pebbles.

Oreos (151) ,Mystery Oreo 2019 ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Mystery-Oreo-2019,"Taste test: This mysterious new flavor came in a package that looked fairly similar to 2017's Mystery Oreo, but honey, they shrunk the package — bringing the weight down from 15.25 oz. to just 12.2 oz.",Smell test: Maybe like carrot cake? ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Brownie Creme Filled  ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Brownie-Creme-Filled,"Taste test: The Oreo Brownie is back for a second try, but unlike the first one we reviewed, which was a licensed product made by Mrs. Freshley's, this one appeared to be genuine Mondelez. Since the other one was mostly just a brownie, with no actual Oreo taste or texture, we were hoping for a more Oreo-like experience this time. Even before opening it the wrapper, we could see white creme showing through one end of the brownie, plus there was a pattern of white frosting on top, so I had reason for optimism.","Smell test: Not much at all, but if I really tried, maybe a weak chocolate cake smell.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Chocolate Bar Mini Macadamia Nuts ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Macadamia-Japan,"Taste test: These Oreos from Japan broke the Oreos formula pretty much entirely, as they were neither sandwiches nor even round. They promised a flavor that I haven't seen in any of the round Oreo sandwiches, so I won't dwell any more on whether they should be sold as Oreos. Each one was individually wrapped in blue foil, about an inch and half long, three-quarters of an inch thick and wide, with a flat bottom and lumpy sides and top.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Chocolate Bar Mini Strawberry ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Japan-Strawberry,"Taste test: These Oreos from Japan took the same form factor as the Macadamia Nuts ones, with a small, dome-profile bar shape, rather than anything remotely round or sandwich-like. Don't confuse them with the Berry Oreos, which had the conventional Oreo shape (and kind of passively disassociated themselves with any specific berries, despite the picture of strawberry).","Smell test: Mild, strawberry-like smell.

Based on the size of the box (about the same as your average cookie box) and the use of ""Pie"" in the singular, I kind of figured it might contain a single pie that resembled a much-oversized Oreo. But when I opened the box, I found that there were six individual packets — not one giant pie. The ""pie"" in each one was a bit bigger than a conventional Oreo, but still quite small by pie standards: 2-1/4 inches in diameter (vs. 1-3/4 inches for an Oreo cookie) and 5/8-inch thick.

The intention here was to aid in using Oreos as part of a recipe. Having twice made the same Oreo Cookie Balls recipe provided on the back of the bag, I can attest that it's quite labor-intensive to crush Oreos into bits as small as the ones in this bag.

One of those flavors was Lemon, but it was not the same as this, since that one used the Golden Oreo cookies, while this one went with the chocolate ones.

Oreos (151) ,"Oreo Red, White & Blue ",https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Red-White-Blue,"Taste test: This version of Oreos promised three layers of creme filling, with the all-American colors. The sandwich pictured on the package set an expectation of how that should look — smooth, perfectly even layers, each full visible across the profile of the sandwich. But when we opened the package, the look was quite different. In most cases, the layers were quite uneven, and you had to look very closely to see all three colors. The blue layer was darker than shown, as it was almost a navy blue.",Smell test: Regular Oreos smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Oreo Team USA ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Team-USA,"Taste test: With the rapid acceleration in the number of limited-edition Oreos recently, we've seen lots of new flavors but precious few changes in cookie design. That drought has finally ended, as this package featured Oreos with the standard markings on one side of each sandwich and an assortment of five Olympic-themed designs on the other. Designs included a cross-country skier; a figure skater; a ski jumper; the American flag and the Olympic rings; and a crest surrounding the words ""Team USA.""

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins,"Taste test: We've seen a proliferation of new varieties of Oreos since we started reviewing them, mostly in terms of new flavors, so it was surprising to spot this change of form. Unlike the previous shape change, Fudge Cremes, which did away with one of the two cookies before applying the fudge coating, this one stayed true to the sandwich cookie concept, promising only thinness.",Smell test: The usual Oreos smell.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Bites ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Bites,"Taste test: This version of Oreos stood apart from the other three ""Thins Bites"" products in lacking a fudge coating. So it was just a reduced-thickness, reduced-diameter Oreo with no change in flavor or extra coating. Thanks to the lack of a coating, I was able to measure the size of the cookies (15/16-inch in diameter), plus I could see the cookies' surface pattern (a downscaled and slightly modified version of the standard Oreo markings).",Smell test: Regular Oreos smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Dark Chocolate ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Dark-Chocolate,"Taste test: This package was labeled as Family Size, and it sure contained a lot of sandwiches, thanks to both the larger size of the package and the thinness of the Thins. I didn't have the patience to count them, but I did have the patience to do math, so multiplying the serving size from the Nutrition Facts by the number of servings meant 52 Oreo sandwiches.",Smell test: More intense chocolate smell than regular Oreos. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Latte ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Latte,"Taste test: This coffee-themed version of Oreo Thins had the usual two thin dark cookies enclosing each sandwich, with a layer of light beige-colored creme filling in between. (It wasn't the first coffee-flavored Oreo, as we previously reviewed their Dunkin' Donuts Mocha and Tiramisu flavors.)","Smell test: Nice mocha-like smell, mild on the coffee part.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Lemon ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Lemon,"Taste test: This latest addition to the Oreo Thins line (along with founding members original, Mint and Golden, and newcomer chocolate filled) had round sandwiches looked like Oreos, except with thinner cookies, so Thins was a very fitting name.","Smell test: Kind of like a lemon meringue smell, but mild.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Mint ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Mint,"Taste test: When the Oreo folks rolled out a thinner version of their flagship cookie, they weren't so shy as to limit the thin to just one flavor for launch. We discovered this Mint version, as well as a Golden one, on the very same visit to the supermarket.",Smell test: A mix of chocolate and a mild mint.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Pistachio ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Pistachio,"Taste test: These Oreos had the same extra-thin black cookies as the other Thins, with a light green filling that looked much like the mint version. I bit in to find a chocolate-and-creme taste on the first bite that didn't seen pistachio-like at all. But shortly after that, when filling reached my tongue, the taste was very strongly like pistachio ice cream.",Smell test: Just the regular chocolate Oreo smell.

Oreos (151) ,Oreo Thins Salted Caramel Crème ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Thins-Salted-Caramel,"Taste test: This version of Oreo Thins had the same slim form factor as the other varieties (now totaling six) and used the same cookies as the Golden and Lemon ones. The difference here was the filling, which had kind of a dull caramel color.",Smell test: Nice caramel smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Oreo Triple Double ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Triple-Double,"Taste test: This version of Oreos broke the mold quite a bit, as the most basic characteristics of an Oreo — two cookies with a creme filling — were thrown out in favor of a whopping three cookies and two creme fillings. So it was sort of like a Big Mac ... without beef patties or buns, of course! As if two layers of filling were not enough, they were two different fillings: one the standard Oreo white creme, and the other a chocolate creme. All of those dramatic changes aside, the most obvious change upon grabbing my first Triple Double out of the tray was how thick the extra cookie and creme layer made it — it was impressively different than a regular Oreo.","Smell test: Smells like regular Oreos, which is to say, very good.

Oreos (151) ,Original Oreo (Indonesia) ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Original-Indonesia,"Taste test: We discovered this box of Indonesia-made Oreos alongside another dubbed Mildly Sweet Oreo. This one itself didn't seem all that notable on its face, but a direct comparison against the Mildly Sweet ones seemed in order, and while we're at it, we might as well see if there's a difference between the North American-made original Oreos and this Asian version.","Smell test: Regular Oreos smell, nice.

Oreos (151) ,PB&J Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Peanut-Butter-and-Jelly,"Taste test: These limited-edition Oreos are evidently a Kroger exclusive, and they mark a return to the Oreo practice of splitting the filling between two different flavor/colors, as we've previously seen in Cotton Candy, Candy Corn, Caramel Apple and Watermelon. The cookies were of the Golden Oreo variety. The peanut butter filling was almost the same color as the cookie, and the jelly was kind of dark purplish.","Smell test: Smells like peanut butter cookies with jelly, but not quite like a PB&J sandwich.

Oreos (151) ,Peanut Butter Creme Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peanut-Butter-Creme-Oreo,"Taste test: After being overwhelmed by the addictiveness and deliciousness of the limited-edition Reese's Oreos, we decided to finally buy a package of these, which aren't marked as having limited availability. They sounded like they should be substantially similar to the Reese's ones, as they too combined peanut butter and chocolate.","Smell test: It does smell like a jar of peanut butter, though milder.

Oreos (151) ,Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peanut-Butter-Oreo-Fudge-Cremes,"Taste test: These cookies were a lot like the original and mint versions of Fudge Cremes (neither of which have much similarity to actual Oreo sandwich cookies) but substituted a peanut butter creme for the Oreo-like creme filling in the others, while retaining the fudge coating.",Smell test: Great peanut butter and chocolate smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Peeps Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peeps-Oreo,"Taste test: This version of Oreos was rather shocking, based on the looks of the package alone — it pushed the design envelope far more than the other Oreo limited editions, so much so that when I first saw it online, I assumed it was just another fake Internet Oreo flavor. But oh, it was for real.","Smell test: Very sweet, but not particularly marshmallow-like.

Oreos (151) ,Peeps Oreo (Chocolate) ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peeps-Oreo-Chocolate,"Taste test: This follow-up to last year's original Peeps Oreo gets more effort points than the original, as they didn't use just the standard Oreo cookie designs, instead presenting a new Peeps-themed design for one side of each sandwich while keeping the standard Oreo markings on the other. The package showed a sandwich with a chicken-shaped Peeps design, but there were actually two different designs inside, as half the cookies depicted a Peeps bunny surrounded by butterflies.","Smell test: Nice, a hint of fruitiness added to the original Oreo smell.

Oreos (151) ,Peppermint Bark Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peppermint-Bark-Oreo,"Taste test: This limited flavor from Oreo — not to be confused with the previous limited edition Peppermint from four years ago — looked mostly like regular Oreos, with the standard markings on the two cookies and a white filling, but they did add a fairly sparse collection of red specks inside the filling. The description on the package gave it away that the creme itself was actually peppermint flavored and that the red stuff was really crunchy bits of sugar, rather than bits of crushed candy cane like some other Peppermint Bark-themed snacks.",Smell test: Smells like all of the other mint Oreos.

Oreos (151) ,Peppermint Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Peppermint-Oreo,"Taste test: This limited-edition flavor of Oreos put a mint filling between two Oreo chocolate cookies with the usual design, and when we offered them to some snackers, everyone was thrilled to grab one to try. The Oreo folks didn't attempt to create the red-and-white stripes that many peppermint snacks have, nor did they do a filling split between red and white (which would similar to other split-filling Oreo flavors such as Candy Corn, Caramel Apple and Reese's), opting instead for just a uniform pinkish filling.",Smell test: Good chocolate mint smell. ,https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&search-alias=grocery&field-brandtextbin=Oreo&linkCode=ll2&tag=taquitosnet-ta-1-20&linkId=9cc9c025dde53f2af53add765d7b7de6
Oreos (151) ,Piña Colada Oreo Thins ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Pina-Colada-Oreo-Thins,"Taste test: This new Oreo flavor, part of a three-way contest with Cherry Cola and Kettle Corn, promised both coconut and pineapple in the creme of what looked like Golden Oreo Thins. We've already reviewed a a coconut version of Oreo Thins, but this was more different than just the pineapple, since the other coconut ones used chocolate cookies.","Smell test: I could make out lots of things — the regular Golden Oreo smell, some coconut and pineapple.

Oreos (151) ,Pumpkin Spice Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Oreo-Pumpkin-Spice,"Taste test: This special version of Oreos had two blonde Oreo cookies enclosing a dark orange filling, with the standard Oreo markings on the outsides of the sandwich. We crunched in to find that they were really good, with the standard Oreo texture and a great pumpkin pie taste. The feel of the creme was slightly gritty, but not really in a bad way — it wasn't anything like a smooth pumpkin pie filling, but it was about as gritty as your normal Oreo creme.

Oreos (151) ,Red Velvet Oreo ,https://www.taquitos.net/cookies/Red-Velvet-Oreo,"Taste test: This limited-edition version of Oreos broke the usual Oreo formula in several ways, the most of significant of which was that the cookies were not the nearly-black regular Oreo ones, nor the beige Golden Oreo ones. You'd expect them to be red then, right? Well, they only very slightly red, if at all — they were basically brown, and a fairly dark brown at that. Whether I could see any red at all seemed to depend on the lighting. I probably wouldn't have noticed the red if I weren't actively looking for it.","Smell test: Yeah, it really smells like cake.

In this case, they've modified the standard Oreo by putting tiny marshmallows within the chocolate cookie (visible as white spots from the outside) and replacing the white creme with a chocolate creme that also featured some bits of soy nuts.","Smell test: Mostly marshmallow, overpowering the chocolate.

The differences started with the filling, which was bright purplish pink instead of green, but the change of the cookies from chocolate to Golden Oreo was far more significant from a snacking perspective. Some of the face designs were different (""Music is Life"" stayed, but headphones and some other musical design that didn't ring any bells for me replaced the cassette and CD).

The green was a bit dull compared to a bright watermelon exterior, while the red was a closer match the the inside of a watermelon, but still somewhat dull. When it's a hot summer day and you're thirsty, there are few things better than a cold juicy slice of watermelon, right?

One of the original flavors that led Pop-Tarts down the path from somewhat nutritious breakfast complement (part of a complete breakfast) into sugar-laden anytime snack was Chocolate Vanilla Creme.   Similar snacksThis version is basically a chocolate Pop-Tart with a vanilla creme (not cream) filling. In this case, eating the tart cooked or uncooked is just as good, depending on whether you want melted filling or not.

Trying to find this flavor is sometimes difficult, it's not as popular as the frosted strawberry, frosted chocolate or (ugh) S'mores flavors. If you find them, buy them, because we want Kellogg's to keep making this flavor. At first we thought that they had replaced this flavor with the Cookies 'n' Creme variety, but this is definitely a different flavor, and the much superior one.

Pop-Tarts (28) ,Pop-Tarts Gone Nutty! Peanut Butter ,https://www.taquitos.net/energy_bars/Pop-Tarts-Peanut-Butter,"Taste test: This Pop-Tarts variety was introduced along with a Chocolate and Peanut Butter version, and I figured that aside from the presence or lack of chocolate, they'd be pretty similar. That turned out to be quite wrong; this was very different from the other one, and it was also very different from all other Pop-Tarts. The most striking change was the lack of any sort of frosting on the top surface, replaced by a thin coating of sugar granules. Beyond that, the whole thing felt less solid than I've come to expect. It felt like the pastry dough that formed the main structure of the Pop-Tart was softer, but the lack of frosting to provide some structural reinforcement may have contributed as well.

Pringles (146) ,Pringles Loud Super Cheesy Italian ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Pringles-Loud-Super-Cheesy-Italian,"Taste test: This flavor from Pringles' Loud line stood out from the other two for the different materials in the underlying chip; while the Spicy Queso and  Salsa Fiesta flavors were primarily corn and were labeled ""Corn Crisps,"" this one was dubbed ""Grain and Vegetable Crisps."" The composition wasn't entirely different, as the first ingredient was still corn, but this also included a ""Grain and Vegetable Blend"" that included carrots, rice, barley, oats, spinach, peas and wheat, plus farther down in the ingredients there were potatoes and more rice.","Smell test: Kind of a typical veggie chips smell, but with some cheese too.

Pringles (146) ,Pringles Mango Salsa ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Pringles-Mango-Salsa,"Taste test: This flavor of Pringles generated a lot of interest, as many snackers apparently have quite a taste for mangoes (though personally I don't like them). It came about a year after the limited-edition Lay's Mango Salsa chip. There was just a bit of orange seasoning on most of the pieces, so not a lot of color.","Smell test: Tangy salsa smell, with some mango.

Pringles (146) ,Pringles Parmesan & Roasted Garlic  ,https://www.taquitos.net/chips/Pringles-Parmesan-Roasted-Garlic,"Taste test: Having reviewed 145 kinds of Pringles, it was a bit surprising to see this one show up as a new flavor — parm & garlic is a pretty common combination found in lots of snacks.
